   HPI: 62yo M h/o chronic gastric outlet obstruction [**3-14**] pancreatic CA
   p/w 6-8 weeks LUQ abd pain and worsening nausea, decreased PO intake
   and vomiting. Today the pt presented to CyberKnife Center for 1 of 3
   planned fractions to pancreas. A CT abdomen revealed a gastric outlet
   obstruction. The pt was tachyc and an O2 Sat was 77% on RA, placed on
   4LO2NC with improvement to 96% and HR returned to low 90's. Pt reports
   decreased po intake over the last couple of days and increased nausea.
   He reports [**8-20**] pain to his left mid-abdomen which radiates through to
   his back and up to his left shoulder and across to his right shoulder.
   The pt was subsequently sent to the E.D.
   .
   In the ED, his vitals were 98.4 75 133/69 rr 16 98%, the pt received 2L
   NS, Zofran 4mg, Morphine 2mg, Combivent Nebs, Solumedrol 125mg,
   Cefepime 2gm, Protonix 40mg. A central line was placed following a
   hypotensive episode to the 70s and the pt was started on levophed
   0.06mcg. CVP was ~7. CXR revealed a large gastric bubble and an NGT was
   placed revealing coffee ground emesis. Labs revealed a 4 point Hct
   Drop. EKG  showed new biphasic TWs V1-2 although CEs 1st set neg. A CT
   Torso was performed to r/o PE, dissection, infection. The pt received
   Unasyn.
   .
   The pt was seen by both ERCP and Surgery that suggested the pt be kept
   NPO overnight, with transfer to the MICU for likely duodenal stenting
   in the AM for gastric outlet obstruction.
   .

   vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,

   CT Abdomen: (Wet-Read)
   Widespread pulmonary ground glass opacities with broad differential
   including infectious, drug reaction, edema, hemorrhage. Aspiration also
   possible but not typical in distribution. New mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy. Dialated stomach suggesting gastric outlet
   obstruction. Recommend NGT placement.
   .
   Assesment: 62yo M h/o chronic gastric outlet obstruction [**3-14**] pancreatic
   CA now presenting with Acute Respiratory Distress and hypotension.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Distress: The pt now on 6L NC from a baseline of no
   O2 in the setting of new ground glass opacities. DDx: includes
   infection (Aspiration PNA, Atypical), inflamatory rxn (potentially
   secondary to chemotherapy, edema, hemorrhage.
   - Keep NG in place
   - Abx to cover aspiration PNA, atypicals. Less likely PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) 2541**]/Cefepime and Doxycylcine (given Cipro and Macrolide allergies)
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension: Episode in ED to SBP in 70s. DDx: Intravascular
   de[** Location **]n secondary to decreased PO, Unlikley Sepsis, Less likley GIB.
   Pt placed on Levophed. NG tube placed without heme positive aspirate.
   - Gentle IVF resuscitation
   - Wean Levophed
   .
   # Gastric Outlet Obstruction: Likely the origin of LUQ abd pain and
   worsening nausea and secondary to extrinsic compression from pancreatic
   mass. NG placed and lavaged
   - ERCP to place duodenal stent
   - Holding off on Cyberknife treatment
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with EKG changes in the setting of a hx of CAD and
   Hct < 30. CEs Negative x1.
   - Serial EKGs
   - Consider transfuse to goal > 30
