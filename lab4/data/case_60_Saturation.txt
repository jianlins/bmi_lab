TITLE:  MICU ATTENDING ADMIT NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 85F htn, cva, AAA repair, HLD, stage 4 CKD,
   and chronic bronchitis (35 py tob) admitted [**1-29**] with LLL pna (s/p
   azithro/ctx), course c/b L lung collapse / mucus plugging requiring
   MICU transfer and 2 prior therapeutic bronchoscopies, last on [**2-5**],
   transferred to floor on [**2-7**]. She had been doing well until this
   morning when she desaturated, with increasing O2 requirement, ABG:
   7.36/41/48, prompting MICU transfer for hypoxemia.
   AF HR 71 BP 124/56 RR 12-16 Sat 100% 5L+ 100% venturi, Alert elderly F
   in NAD, w/o acc muscle use, wheezy, distant BS, decreased BS over left
   mid/lower zone, RR, soft NT, + BS, no edema
   Labs: lactate 0.7, WBC 7.7, HCT 28, plt 294, bicarb 19, K 4.5, cr 3.4
   (b/l), trop 0.04 with flat ck/mb.
   CXRs reviewed--worsening of LLL/lingular collapse
   Hypoxemia--most likely [**2-13**] recurrent mucus plugging of LLL in pt with
   minimal pulmonary reserve. She just completed CAP treatment and remains
   AF without leukocytosis to suggest recurrent infection, She is HD
   stable and does not appear volume overloaded. Clinical suspicion for PE
   is very low and she remains on DVT prophylaxis. Her respiratory status
   appears comfortable now and her O2 saturation is 99-100%. Agree with
   plan for aggressive chest PT, continuing standing nebs and mucomyst.
   Will repeat ABG to assess A-a gradient and wean O2 as able and repeat
   CXR in early am. Given sig wheeze, will give brief steroid taper for
   copd component. Monitor clinical status closely with low threshold to
   move toward therapeutic bronch which would require intubation. Keep NPO
   for now, pending further improvement. Consider obtaining chest CT. ICU:
   full code, PPI, sq heparin, PIVs. Remainder of plan as outlined in
   resident note.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
