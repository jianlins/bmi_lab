   Presented few days ago with zoster ophthalmicus, started on acyclovir;
   today also unasyn for concern re: superinfection.  Neurology had been
   following for myasthenia, concern re: progressive weakness.  IVIG
   started this morning.  This PM got benadryl, acute confusion and on
   exam by neurologist found to have increased weakness.  MIP 24, FVC 900
   (no prev this admit).

   Chem-7 with rising bicarb

   ABG 7.48/41/76
   Baseline bicarb appears to be ~29-30, no prev ABG or PFTs.
   CXR clear.
   EKG ordered.
   Plan:
   Weakness, myasthenia:
   For dyspnea, MIPs / VC and rising bicarb very concerning; ABG
   surprisingly OK, in setting of baseline elevated bicarb consistent /
   suggestive of chronic CO2 retention.  Will need to follow closely,
   consider NIPPV (if even possible, given opthalmicus) vs intubation if
   progresses.
   For myasthenia, per neuro: cont steroids / cellcept / IVIG.
   Zoster / leukocytosis: acyclovir, now on unasyn, lidocaine / neurontin
   for pain.
