MICU ATTENDING NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 62F severe late-stage ARDS and progressive
   ARF; BAL +MRSA. Creatinine stable. Acute decompensation this AM,
   emergent bronch at bedside to reposition elevated ETT.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4 BP 120/60 HR 95 RR 40 with sat 99 on VAC
   280x40/40 PEEP 10 0.6 42/40 7.28/50/67 CVP 7. Bronchial BS B. RRR s1s2.
   Soft, no BS. 2+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 10K, HCT 22, K+ 4.6, Cr 3.9
   (from 3.8). CXR with B ASD, stable.
   Tube repositioned following paralysis with vecuronium. Will increased
   PEEP and decrease Vt, if needed, once Eos pressures rechecked. Overall
   compliance appears to be worsening. Will continue fent/midaz for
   sedation, and start methadone and valium PGT given large sedative
   requirements. Will continue vanco to level for MRSA pneumonia based on
   BAL results, recheck sputum today. If MRSA persists, I would favor
   linezolid. Decrease steroids to MP 40 every 12 hours. For stable ARF,
   will renal dose meds and continue phosphate binder. Tolerating TFs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   key issues:
    1. resp: hypoxic resp failure with ARDS: extremely poor compliance.
       Has been intubated > 1 wk. Will measure Vd/Vt. Trach is appropriate
       at this point.
    2. pneumonia: repeat sputum cx for decision regarding linezolid rather
       than vanc for MRSA.
    3. sedation: continue with regimen in hope that methadone and valium
       will allow reduction of fent/versed.
    4. hct trending down, phlebotomy in addition to likely ACD. 2U PRBC.
    5. progressive renal failure of unclear etiology- likely ATN.
       Ap[** Location **]te renal input. Avoid further IVF aside from PRBC. No
       diuretecs.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 35 min
