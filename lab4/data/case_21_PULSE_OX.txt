Chief Complaint: resp failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   65M w/ AML s/p allo-SCT - over the past 5 days or so has been
   experiencing worsening dyspnea. Today became more SOB at home following
   epidsode of diarrhea. VNA measured pulse ox in 70's and sent him to ER.
   In ER 7.31/68/118 on unclear amount of O2.
   In ER, he was inubated and a CXR showed LLL infiltrate. He required CVL
   placement and was placed on levophed. He received IVF and broad
   antibiotics. His pressors have been weaned and his hemodynamics have
   stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure - new volume loss and possible effusion on left likely due
   to mucus plugging in setting of infection, will continue broad
   antibiotics. Increase PEEP and if his LLL does not re-aerate, a CT may
   be necessary to look for effusion.
   Hypotension - suspect related to infection. Received IVF and pressors
   now off. Will follow
   CML/allo-SCT/GVHD - continue outpatient regimen of immunosuppression
   though will increase steroids briefly, continue prophylactic regimen.
   Elevated troponin - improving, unclear significance, follow EKG
   Diarrhea - check CDiff
   DVT/PE - continue lovenox
   Elevated LFTs - follow, may be GVHD, image if necessary
