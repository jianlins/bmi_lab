Chief Complaint:  dyspnea, worsening hypoxia
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3624**] is a 55 yo M with end-stage sarcoid on 3LNC at
   baseline, transferred from Radius with shortness of breath, tachypnea,
   hypoxia and fevers.  According to reports from Radius has has been
   hypoxic for several days with O2 sats 91-92% on 100% NRB with
   desaturation to 86% with minimal exertion, patient refusing to come to
   hospital.
   .
   In the ED T99.2 BP 145/84 RR 20-30 HR 92-140 96% on 100%NRB.  He was
   noted to be significantly hypoxic and tachypnic and was intubated due
   to concern for increasing work of breathing.  He was given 2.5LNS,
   levofloxacin 750mg IV, cefepime 2g IV x1, decadron 10mg IV x1 and
   versed 2mg IV x1.
   Patient admitted from: Transfer from other hospital, Radius

   Past Medical History:
   1. Hepatitis C, diagnosed as part of the lung transplant workup
   at the [**Hospital1 **]. He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 61**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3625**] in GI. He
   is hepatitis B core surface antibody positive and surface
   antigen negative.  In addition, he has hepatitis C antibody plus type
   2b with a viral load in [**9-/3286**], of 5.5 million. He had grade 2
   fibrosis on [**3285-5-23**]. He is not thought to be a candidate
   currently for interferon treatment given his sarcoidosis.
   2. Sarcoidosis. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient has
   been obtaining PFTs from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1099**], and he is currently on
   azathioprine and prednisone with prophylaxis Bactrim.
   3. Sleep apnea.
   4. Erectile dysfunction.
   5. Emotional lability and anxiety.
   6. Status post mandible fracture [**9-14**].
   7. Status post multiple rib and clavicle fractures
   8. Spinal stenosis: diagnosed on MRI and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 90**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The diagnosis was established as part of a workup for
   progressive lower leg weakness, which led to multiple falls and
   currently an inability to ambulate.
   9. Shingles in [**1-/3286**] on the right side of the face with
   residual neuropathic pain.

   1. Small PE of segmental/subsegmental right upper lobe branch. This was

   Multiple additional bilateral healing rib fractures.
   3. Healing left distal clavicle fracture.
   3. Resolution of right upper lobe pneumonia.
   4. Chronic severe pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of sarcoidosis.
   .
   [**3286-12-3**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function
   appears depressed. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3286-10-31**], right
   ventricular systolic function now appears depressed.

   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3624**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of end stage sarcodiosis
   admitted with fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia intubated in ED [**2-8**] concern
   for increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
   .
   #SIRS/Sepsis - meets criteria based on tachycardia and bandemia of 29%
   on diff,most likely due to PNA given underlying severe sarcoidosis,
   other consideration is infected midline which has been in place for
   unclear duration of time.  UA unremarkable and unlikely the source but
   will f/u.
   -vancomycin IV to cover for possible line infection
   -meropenam given recent h/o resistant pseudomonas on recent sputum cx
   -ua unremarkable, f/u urine culture
   -d/c midline, send tip for culture
   -BP had been stable until propofol started, will d/c propofol and
   -IVF for CVP 8-10, will start levophed if MAP still < 65 despite CVP at
   goal
   .
   #Hypoxemic respiratory failure - in setting of report of fever
   concerning for superimposed PNA on severe pulmonary fibrosis [**2-8**] end
   stage sarcoid.  No clear infiltrate on CXR although difficult to
   interpret in the setting of already severe pulmonary fibrosis.
   -treat for possible PNA given high susceptibility given underlying
   pulmonary abnormalities
   -vanc/meropenam for now for broad coverage given recent h/o multidrug
   resistant pseudomonas (resistant to zosyn and cefepime)
   -send sputum culture
   -f/u blood cultures
   -continue mechanical ventillation, wean FIO2 as tolerated for Sat >90
   -consider bronchoscopy to obtain sputum sample
   -consider CT scan to further evaluate for degree of airway disease
   -albuterol/atrovent MDI
   .
   #End stage sarcodiosis - has severe sarcoid at baseline on high dose
   steroids.
   -continue high dose steroids for now with solumedrol 60mg IV Q6
   -continue PCP prophylaxis [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/bactrim
   -consider bronch/CT scan as discussed above
   -continue mechanical ventillation
   -continue azathioprine
   .
   #H/O severe anxiety - on multiple agents at baseline for severe anxiety
   including ativan, risperdal, mirtazapine, haldol.
   -Will hold for now while sedated for mechanical ventillation
   -resume once getting close to weaning
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis - on chronic ms contin/percocet, will
   hold for now and sedate with fentanyl/midazolam while intubated.
   .
   #Type 2 DM
 likely component [**2-8**] chronic steroids

   Case reviewed, pt examined and primary data reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**],
   whose note reflects my thoughts. Briefly, patient is a 53M with
   advanced sarcoidosis c/b end stage fibrosis and severe PHTN, HCV,
   osteopenia, recent abd wall hematoma, zoster c/b neuropathic pain
   admitted with progressive respiratory failure from rehab. Intubated in
   ED, currently critically ill on A/C vent and with borderline BP. RIJ
   placed in ED, rx steroids, abx and xfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 42**]. Remainder of
   PMH/HPI/ROS as above, NKDA.

   A/P
 53M end stage sarcoidosis now with likely sepsis from pneumonia
   and respiratory failure.
     -  Will change to PSV for better synchrony and sedate with fent /
   midaz.
     -  Advance ETT 2cm, cover with [**Last Name (un) 411**] and vanco
     -  Will send sputum and bronch if able to tolerate lower FiO2 to
   speciate PSA and r/o PCP
     [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  [**Name9 (PRE) **] treat with IV steroids since he has been on them and still
   appears wheezy
     -  Check Legionella Ag and beta-glucan, hold azathioprine, continue
   bactrim TIW for now
     -  Pan culture and consider CT though this is unlikely to change
   treatment at this point
     -  D/c PICC now and continue vanco, consider LENIs for ?DVT in AM
     -  Start TFs
     -  Pneumoboots
