Chief Complaint:  Instability/weakness
   HPI:
   This is an 81-year-old female with a history of stage IV NSCLC
   diagnosed in [**5-/3129**], now getting palliative XRT, who presents today
   after she was unable to rise from a seated position on her bed.
   Patient states that she was sitting on her bed tonight and tried to get
   up to go to the comode, but felt "very imbalanced" and sat back on the
   bed.  She subsequently was able to make her way to the toilet, but her
   husband was worried that she was so unsteady that he called 911.
   Patient reports noticable instability for the past few weeks; nothing
   acute, but increased trouble rising from a seated position and extra
   help needed with ADLs.  She denies any falls in the past few weeks.
   Upon arrival in the ED, patient was found to be short of breath, with
   an 02 sat of 50-60% on room air.  She immediately came up to 100% with
   a face mask.  A CXR was done, which showed a significantly larger
   pleural effusion.  Patient received a CTA over concern for PE, which
   was negative.  EKG showed frequent PVCs, but no concerning ST changes.
   Troponin was 0.02 and patient received ASA.  Initial vitals were: T:
   98.0, HR 86, BP: 146/71, RR: 22.  Vitals upon transfer were: HR: 103,
   BP: 160/83, RR: 25, SP02: 98% on 5 liters.  Patient was more
   comfortable, though still breathing at 25 times/minute.
   ROS:  Patient actually denies any trouble breathing, stating that she
   has had some DOE, but nothing at rest.  She also denies any fever,
   "chest congestion," nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, hemoptysis,
   dysuria, or other symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81-year-old female with a past medical history of NSCLC who
   presents from home with a 2-day history of worsening shortness of
   breath.
   INSTABILITY/WEAKNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9882**] main complaint on arrival is
   instability and inability to get up off her bed without falling.
   Complaint is likely multifactorial, with etiologies including
   hypercalcemia, deconditioning, and poor a[** Location **]e and intake.  Patient
   also has a history of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, which could
   contribute to her weakness.  Moreover, in a patient with cancer,
   neurologic emergencies such as cord compression cannot be ruled out.
   --Treat hypercalcemia with IVF (see below)
   --Puruse other endocrinopathies including hypothyroidism and low
   cortisol.  Unlikely diabetes with normal glucose.
   --PT consult
   --Continue to follow neuro exams; consider rectal exam to assess tone
   in the AM.
   --CT head [** Location **] read negative for intracranial process; follow-up
   final read
   --Consider nutrition consult to ensure patient is taking in appropriate
   calories
 HYPERCALCEMIA (HIGH CALCIUM):  Patient with elevated calcium,
   espeically in light of low albumin.  In addition to other etiologies,
   paraneoplastic syndrome must be entertained in an individual with lung
   cancer (possibly squamous).
   --IVF for now as patient tolerates clinically (attention to respiratory
   status)
   --Trend calcium
   --Discontinue HCTZ for now, as this can increase ca2+
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:
   --Hold Hctz for now in setting of hypercalcemia
   --[**Month (only) 11**] need to add another [**Doctor Last Name 23**] if BP continues to run high
 HYPOXEMIA:   Shortness of breath most likely from increasing tumor
   burden and worsening pulmonary effusions.  Other possibilities include
   infection, cardiac cause, or pulmonary embolus (though ruled out with
   CTA).  Infection is unlikely given absence of fever, leukocytosis, or
   localizing symptoms.  Cardiac cause is also lower on the differential
   given an absence of cardiac history.
   --Continue 02 for now, with attempt to wean
   --Repeat ABG if sats continue to drop, patient becomes more hypoxic, or
   clinical status worsens
   --CT-guided thoracentesis, as effusions are very loculated and hard to
   tap at bedside
   --Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2683**] re: patient admission and condition
   --Consider antibiotics only if condition deteriorates, patient becomes
   febrile, develops leukocytosis, etc.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG:  Patient with stage IV NSCLC.
   Patient was unable to tolerate chemotherapy after her initial
   diagnosis, and is currently being treated with palliative XRT.  The
   plan is for further evaluation of her cytology, with the possibility of
   further systemic treatment.  We will touch base with patient's primary
   oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2683**].
