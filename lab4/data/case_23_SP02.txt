Chief Complaint:  SOB
   HPI:
   82M with CAD, chronic diastolic CHF, AFib on coumadin admitted with
   dyspnea. Three days ago patient notes that he was not feeling well. He
   was more fatigued than usual and had shortness of breath with walking.
   He did not have palpitations, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea,
   pnd, worse edema than baseline (has had chronic LE edema X 5 years),
   syncope, or presyncope. At about 3 am on the morning of admission he
   awoke to turn down the AC because he was chilly. When he sat up he
   became acutely short of breath. His wife was able to calm him down and
   when he lay back down he felt better. However, over the course of the
   next few hours he started to feel more and more short of breath, even
   when lying down, and by 7am his wife was very concerned. She noticed
   that when she tried to stand him up to walk to the living room he was
   very weak and his legs were wobbly. She called 911, and they brought
   him to the ED.
   .
   Upon presentation to the ED initial vitals were: T 98 HR 76 BP 179/68
   RR 28 SP02 98%RA. In the ED patient denied CP, fever, chills, cough,
   weight gain. His O2 sats declined from 98% on RA ->91% on 4L->96% on
   NRB. CXR showed mild fluid overload and possible PNA. Bedside TTE
   revealed:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There
   is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
   There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   .
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2728-4-23**], the findings are similar.
   .
   He received the following medications: Aspirin 81mg, CeftriaXONE 1g,
   Azithromycin 500mg, Nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg SLX3 (for HF not for
   complaints of CP), and Furosemide 80mg IV X 1. He felt better after the
   furosemide (he put out 500mL) and his O2 requirement came down to 94%
   on 4L. He was transferred to the floor.
   .
   On the floor patient remained on NC and then on first set of vitals was
   noted to be hypoxic to the mid-80s on 5L NC. He was placed on a NRB and
   his O2 sat came up to 100%. He had no complaints of chest pain,
   palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or
   cough at the time. His EKG was unchanged from prior. A CXR was also
   unchanged. ABG showed an elevated A-a gradient with PO2 103 on the NRB.
   He was given another 80mg IV lasix, morphine, and started on nitro
   paste. Intially he improved with this regimen, however, he would
   occasionally dip into the high 80s and then recover spontaneously on
   the NRB and they were unable to wean him off the NRB. He was
   transferred to the CCU for his continued requirement of the NRB.
   .
   On presentation to the ccu the patient was comfortable on a NC. He
   denied fevers, chills, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
   diaphoresis, abdominal pain, bloating, worsening edema, weight gain,
   diarrhea, and dysuria. He endorsed shortness of breath as outlined
   above although currently less than prior, constipation off and on for
   several years, and chronic edema of his lower extremities for the last
   5 years - treated with lasix.

   [**2729-12-5**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
   normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   TTE [**2731-9-1**] on floor:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left
   ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There may be inferolateral
   hypokinesis but views are technically suboptimal. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
   laterally directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2729-12-5**], mitral
   regurgitation is now more prominent. There may be inferolateral
   hypokinesis in the current study but images are technically suboptimal
   for assessment of regional wall motion. The left ventricular cavity is
   now more dilated.
   CXR in ED [**2731-9-1**]: Bilateral perihilar opacities are noted.
   There is a tiny right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The
   heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
   Degenerative changes of the spine are noted.
   IMPRESSION:
   Bilateral perihilar opacities may represent congestive heart failure
   versus pneumonia. In the setting of the patient's elevated BNP,
   findings more likely represent moderate congestive heart failure.
   CXR on floor [**2731-9-1**]: Bilateral peri-hilar opacities and unchanged
   cardiomegaly. No change from prior CXR from same day.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o CAD s/p PCTA 15 years ago,
   diastolic CHF with h/o fluid overload on lasix, afib on coumadin with
   recent admission for retinal occlusion while on warfarin, now admitted
   with DOE, hypoxia, and fever.
   # Hypoxia: Likely this is multifactorial. He has evidence of volume
   overload on exam, on CXR, and with his elevated BNP. In addition he has
   had fever and a questionable infiltrate on his CXR although he denies
   productive cough and sick contacts he could have PNA. PE is less likely
   since he is systemically anti-coagulated and he has other more likely
   etiologies for his hypoxia ([**Doctor Last Name **] score 4). However, his INR was
   subtherapeutic on admission so this remains a possibility.
   - Will continue treatment for community acquired pneumonia with
   azithromycin and cetriaxone given the fever, hypoxia and possible
   infiltrates on CXR.
   - TTE showed new LV dilation likely causing more severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with
   preserved LVEF (although this is likely over-estimated in MR)
   consistent with acute exacerbation of his diastolic CHF. Will treat
   symptomatically with lasix with goal I/O of negative 1-2L today.
   - Will cycle cardiac enzymes to rule out acute coronary event although
   more likely the slight elevation is from stretch from fluid overload
   rather than ACS.
   - Daily I/O, weights
   - Low salt diet
   - Patient is unable to tolerate ACE-I or beta blockers [**2-2**] ADRs in
   past. Will continue on current blood pressure regimen for afterload
   reduction with felodipine and hydralazine and continue statin and ASA
   - Non-invasive ventilation as needed to keep O2 sats >90%
   - LENIs in am to r/o DVT as if he has a DVT while on coumadin he has
   technically failed anti-coagulation and may need IVC filter to avoid
   PEs.
   - Will hold off on CTA for PE as more likely diagnoses at this time and
   [**Doctor Last Name **] score only 4.
   - CXR in am to evaluate for blossoming of the PNA and lessening of
   pulmonary edema with diuresis
   # Fever: Most likely infectious with either pulmonary or urinary
   infection being most probable given leukocytosis, positive UA and
   hypoxia with CXR showing possible infiltrate.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - Continue to treat for CAP with CTX and azithromycin. [**Month (only) 47**] be able to
   change to an oral regimen if stabilizes over next few days and cultures
   do not grow resistent organisms.
   - Will treat for UTI with ceftriaxone.
   - Follow up cultures and narrow antibiotics as able.
   # CORONARIES: Patient has remote history of CAD s/p PTCA at OSH and
   currently has slightly elevated troponins with flat CKs and negative
   MBs in the setting of CRF. currently denies anginal symptoms although
   his SOB could be an anginal equivalent and it is possible that 3 days
   ago he had an acute event causing the acute exacerbation of his CHF.
   More likely, however, is that because of his infection he developed
   fluid overload and ventricular dilation causing troponin elevation that
   was not cleared [**2-2**] his renal failure.
   - Will cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - AM EKG
   - Continue asa, statin at home dose. Unable to tolerate beta blockers
   and ace inhibitors.
   # PUMP: Patient has history of diastolic dysfunction and has had
   episodes of fluid overload treated with oral lasix in the past. TTE
   today revealed new LV dilation and likely as a result worsening of his
   MR [**First Name (Titles) 608**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Unclear etiology of his new LV dilation although
   potentially [**2-2**] infection vs late presentation of ACS.
   - Will treat acute exacerbation of diastolic CHF as above with lasix,
   daily weights, I/O, salt restricted diet and home medications
   - Goal I/O 2L over 24 hours
   # RHYTHM:  currently in slow afib with some EKGs looking like wandering
   pacemaker and rate controlled in 50s. CHADS2 score 5.
   - Will continue calcium channel blocker as ADR with beta blocker
   - EKG in am
   - heparin gtt given sub-therapeutic INR on admission and recent retinal
   artery occlusion (thought more likely to be plaque not embolic from
   heart per notes but no documentation from OSH where diagnosed so
   unclear and thus higher risk patient than average AFib)
   - continue coumadin 5mg for now as starting on abx and likely to
   increase coumadin level so no need for increasing his home dose now.
   - check daily INRs
   # Hypertension: Patient's BP was 170/70 at recent PCP visit and has
   been dificult to control according to OMR notes for last several years.
   Unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors or beta blockers
   - Will continue hydral/Imdur for afterload reduction
   - Will continue CCB
   - Will continue clonidine [**Hospital1 7**] given rebound effect with daily dosing
   - Consider nitro gtt if hypertensive and acutely sob overnight although
   on floor patient reportedly had [** Location **]itous drop in BP when this was
   attempted.
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Currently patient is below his baseline
   creatinine of 1.7.
   -          Will continue home regimen and follow creatinines daily
   #  Hyperlipidemia: As above will continue home dose of statin.
   .
   #  Gout: Will continue home dose of allopurinol
