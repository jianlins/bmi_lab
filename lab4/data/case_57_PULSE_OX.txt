Chief Complaint:   bleed
   HPI:
   81yo female with multiple medical problems including CVA in [**3012**],
   hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was admitted from the cath lab with
   wire perforation and bleeding during peripheral vascular procedure.
   .
   She underwent noninvasive imaging studies of her lower extremities,
   which demonstrated totally occluded bilateral superficial femoral
   arteries. She underwent left SFA stenting at [**Hospital1 17**] on [**3026-2-14**] and then
   presented to [**Hospital1 17**] on this day of admission for right SFA stenting.
   While in the cath lab, a catheter was introduced into the left femoral
   artery and wired through to the right SFA when a wire perforation
   occurred in the right SFA. She developed bleeding into the right thigh.
   She developed swelling in her right leg with thigh circumference of
   52cm compared to left thigh of 46 cm.
   .
   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of pulmonary
   embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
   cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
   fevers, chills, or rigors.  All of the other review of systems were
   negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   - 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**3023-7-29**] demonstrated:  Regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation
   most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - ETT performed on [**3023-10-6**] demonstrated: No objective evidence of
   myocardial ischemia by EKG. No anginal symptoms. Moderate grade AEA.
   Nuclear report sent separately. ; Severe, fixed myocardial perfusion
   defect of the basal inferior segment. Moderate, fixed defect of the
   basal inferolateral segment. No reversible defects at the level of
   exercise stress achieved. Normal left ventricular cavity size.
   Hypokinetic basal inferior and inferolateral segments with calculated
   LVEF 61%.
   - CARDIAC CATH performed on [**3026-3-7**] demonstrated:

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo female with history of CVA, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia is
   admitted to the CCU for monitoring after right SFA perforation during
   right SFA stenting procedure.
   1. Bleed
   Patient has evidence of bleeding into the right thigh related to right
   SFA perforation. Patient continues to have adequate blood flow into her
   lower extremities with palpable DP pulses and dopplerable PT pulses
   bilaterally.
   - will check q4h Hct overnight
   - maintain active T+S with blood consent
   - keep 2 peripheral IVs
   - hold heparin SC
   - restart aspirin and clopidogrel in the AM if blood counts are stable
   2. Hypertension
   Patient's blood pressure is under adequate control currently.
   - continue amlodipine, lopressor, and cozaar at home doses
   - will consider giving hydralazine prn or nitro gtt overnight if
   patient has elevated blood pressures
   3. GERD
   Stable
   - consider PPI prn if needed
   4. Peripheral Vascular Disease
   Patient has marked peripheral vascular disease and has undergone left
   SFA stent within the last 30 days.
   - restart aspirin and clopidogrel tomorrow AM if blood counts are
   stable
   - will follow-up as an outpatient regarding repeat attempt at right SFA
   - continue statin
