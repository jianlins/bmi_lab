   Assessment and Plan
   An 80 year old lady with DM, ESRD and history of subdural hematomas
   presents with new acute/subacute hematomas and hyperkalemia with
   altered mental status.  On admission she appears somnolent but oriented
   and able to defend her airway.
   1) Hyperkalemia: Likely from her renal failure and limited dialysis the
   week prior.  Also per her sister there was some possible dietary
   indiscretion in prepartion for her scheduled line replacement today.
   Currently 5.8 down from 6.7 in ED.
   - Hemodialysis today in ICU
   - Renal following
   - Replete lytes prn
   - EKG on arrival to unit
   - Continue Sevelamer & Cincalcet
   2) Hematomas: Patient has hematomas etiology uncertain.  No fall or
   syncopal history.  Could be uremia + hypertension.
   - Ap[** Location **]te Neurosurgical reccomendations
   - Repeat Head CT @ 9:30pm (12hours post original)
   - q1 hour neuro checks
   - Control BP with labetalol IV & PO
   - Dilantin load complete- 100mg IV TID starting in AM with levels
   daily.
   - Hold ASA, anticoagulation
   3) ESRD: Continue dialysis scheduled as above
   - Renal consult
   4) Diabetes Mellitus:
   - Hold Starlix
   - Lantus + RISS
   5) Toxic multinodular goiter: Continue Methimazole 15mg home dose
   6) Hyperlipidemia:  Continue atorvastatin
