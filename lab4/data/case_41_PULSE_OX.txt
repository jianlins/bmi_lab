Chief Complaint:  fever and hypotension
   HPI:
   49 yo female with metastatic colon cancer on chemotherapy and s/p renal
   transplant on peritoneal dialysis was admitted from the ED with fever
   to 10 and hypotension to 80.
   .
   Patient reports that 2 days ago ([**2987-5-12**]) she awoke with pain in her
   left lower quadrant, which she describes as a "hurting" pain, no
   radiations, worse with touching and movement, and with no known
   relievers. Associated symptoms include the following:
   - nausea
   - vomiting: nonbloody, nonbilious
   - [**3-11**] stools per day: loose, nonbloody, watery but mixed with stool
   - inability to tolerate solid or liquid POs
   - an episode of shaking chills on Saturday [**2987-5-12**]
   - productive cough with nonbloody but yellow-colored sputum
   She otherwise denies dysuria, back pain, headache, or neck pain. She
   also reports that she has had difficulty tolerating her oral
   medications the last 2-3 days. Of note, patient was [** Location **]usly admitted
   to the MICU in [**3-16**] after being hypotensive in the IR suite. Her
   hypotension was thought most likely secondary to hypovolemia given that
   her symptoms improved rapidly with fluid resuscitation alone.
   .
   Upon admission to the ED, vital signs were 98.4, HR 124, BP 133/102 and
   follow-up BP 86/64, and 100% RA. While in the ED, her blood pressure
   declined to as low as 80/49. She received 2.3L NS, tylenol 650mg PR,
   zofran 2mg x 1, vancomycin 1 g x 1, and ceftriaxone 1g x 1.

   Social History:
   1. Metastatic Colon Cancer
   Patient initially presented with bowel obstruction in [**2983**] and
   underwent resection, which revealed a stage III colon adenocarcinoma
   with lymphovascular, venous, and perineural invasion. She underwent
   treatment with FOLFOX. Then in [**2986-9-6**], she was undergoing
   evaluation for a third renal transplant, when she was found to have a
   mass on CXR. Follow-up PET scan demonstrated FDG-avid right upper lobe
   mass and left adrenal gland. Pathology was consistent with metastatic
   colon adenocarcinoma. She underwent 3 cycles of capecitabine and
   oxaliplatin. her course has been complicated by hypotension and patient
   was recommended to increase her salt intake.
   2. ESRD
   Patient is now s/p two failed renal transplants (first transplant from
   sister in [**2958**] and second transplant in [**2980**]) and has restarted
   peritoneal dialysis in late [**2986**]/early [**2987**]. Now undergoes peritoneal
   dialysis 3 times per day
   3. s/p stroke in 8/98 with no residual deficit

   Known right mid lung mass is seen. A second mass in the right
   upper lung is partially visualized though evaluation is limited due to
   overlying ekg lead. Recommend repeat study after removing the EKG
   leads.
   - [**2987-5-14**] - CT Abd/Pelvis -
   1. New evidence of thickened bowel loop in the left lower quadrant,
   which has a broad differential and may be due to low albumin or
   compression from other adjacent structures.
   2. No significant change in the pelvic mass size.
   3. Mild enlargement in the left adrenal lesion.
   4. Moderate ascites and free fluid in the pelvis.
   - CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis - [**2987-4-12**]
   1. Enlarging right upper lobe mass lesion as noted above.
   2. Moderate pericardial effusion.
   3. Moderate ascites.
   4. Enlarging left adrenal lesion.
   5. Enlarging pelvic mass lesion which may represent a metastatic
   focus.  Ultrasound may be used for further characterization of this
   finding is clinically dictated.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   49 yo female with history of metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, SLE, ESRD
   on peritoneal dialysis s/p 2 failed transplants, and history of
   [** Location **]us stroke was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] with sepsis.
   .
   PLAN:
   1. Sepsis
   Patient admitted with sepsis, given that she has evidence of fever and
   leukocytosis. Most likely sources include abdominal source given LLQ
   tenderness and findings on CT scan. Differential includes Cdiff
   (especially given elevated WBC) or other infectious colitis. Additional
   infectious sources include urinary or pulmonary source. Peritoneum
   appears unlikely source given the peritoneal fluid. Blood is certainly
   another possibility given history of shaking chills and fever.
   - send UA and culture
   - send stool culture and C. diff
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - send sputum gram culture and stain
   - start broad spectrum antibiotics with cefepime given that patient is
   immunosuppressed and at risk for pseudomonas, vancomycin given risk for
   MRSA, flagyl given concern for C. diff, and azithromycin for atypical
   coverage
   - wean antibiotics once cultures and sensitivities have returned
   - IVF bolus as needed for goal MAP > 65
   .
   2. ESRD on PD
   Patient on PD due to ESRD secondary to SLE. Has missed last three
   treatments at home due to feeling ill.
   - ap[** Location **]te renal recs
   - start peritoneal dialysis tonight per renal recs
   - continue sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression
   - check rapamycin levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   .
   3. SLE
   Stable
   - continue plans per outpatient rheumatologist
   .
   4. Metastatic Colon Adenocarcinoma
   Patient now on chemotherapy.
   - continue current management per outpatient oncology team
   .
   5. Stroke
   Patient with a history of stroke in the past. Has had neurologic
   deficits in the setting of hypotension during her recent admission in
   [**3-16**]
   - continue aspirin
