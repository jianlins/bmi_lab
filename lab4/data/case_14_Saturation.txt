Date of service: [**3492-12-26**]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   History of present illness: This is an 85 yo male with a history of
   idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
   [**Hospital 1613**] hospital S/p ventricular fibrillation arrest.  He collapsed
   in his house and had been down for 2 minutes when EMS arrived.  He was
   received 120J Biphasic and amiodarone 150mg IV followed by continuous
   infusion by EMS for presumed V. fib/VT and subsequently arrived at [**Hospital 5248**].  Cooling protocol was initiated sometime between presentation at
   [**Hospital3 **] ~ 7:30 AM, then was MedFlighted.  He had reached 89 degrees
   Centigrade by presentation to [**Hospital1 17**] at 10:30 AM on [**3492-12-26**].
   .
   [**Name (NI) **] wife reports that patient came from bathroom this AM at 7AM
   and lied down.  His wife tried to talk to him, but he was
   unresponsive.  She contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS ~ 5 minutes afterwards, and EMS
   arrived in 2 minutes.  They felt rhythm was Ventricular fibrillation,
   and he received 1 shock and revereted to a narrow complex rhythm.  On
   presentation to [**Hospital1 17**] ED, patient had been intubated and cooled to 89
   degrees Fahrenheit.  He received Vecuronium IV and was started on
   fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.  On arrival to CCU, vital signs
   were 52, 218/109, T:33 Celsius, O2 Sat 100% on 100% FiO2.  He was
   transiently on a nitroglycerin gtt which was turned off once patient
   became hypotensive to 70s systolic, and pressure returned to 130s
   systolic.  He was experiencing several runs of wide-complex
   tachycardia, appearing monomorphic on telemetry, and received another
   150mg IV amiodarone.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with COPD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, who presents
   S/P Ventricular fibrillatory arrest
   1.  V fib arrest - Unclear etiology.  Ischemia is possibility, despite
   relative clean coronaries on [**3490**] angiography.  [**Month (only) 47**] also be [** Location **]posed
   to ventricular arrhythmia due to dilated cardiomyopathy, and this is a
   more likely explanation.  Electrolytes repleted.
   - Arctic sun protocol x 18 hours.
   - Consider Head imaging if mental status remains obscured after cooling
   protocol.
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers, and q6 hour labs for cooling protocol.
   - Repeat ECG in AM
   - Consider beta-blockade if heart rate tolerates, definitely start
   after cooling protocol is finished.
   - Continue aspirin for now, consider heparin if elevation in biomarkers
   of if there is polymorphic VT recurrence
   2.  COPD - Continue Advair, Nebs
   3.  Access - Peripheral IVs for now, no current indication for central
   venous access
   4. Prophylaxis - Pantoprazole, heparin SC
   5.  Code status - full, confirmed with wife
   6.  Communication - with wife and [**Name2 (NI) **]

   Cardiology Fellow Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:

   Medical Decision Making
   85 year old man with h/o idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF
   of 25%, recent cath 07 which showed non-flow limiting CAD who presents
   with witness V-fib arrest returning to spontaneous circulation post 2
   shocks and amiodarone iv.
   Vfib arrest: unlikely [**1-2**] ischemia since Trop elevation marginal, no
   ECG changes indicative of ischemia, recent cath with no flow limiting
   CAD, cooling for 18 h with warming at 10 AM [**3492-12-27**], neurological
   assessment at that time, EP consult at that time to evaluate for ICD
   placement due to low EF, will optimize CHF management at the time
   HTN: likely [**1-2**] cooling, minimal responsive constricted pupils b/l, no
   trauma to head, unlikely due to neurologic trauma, cont nitro and
   follow clinically
