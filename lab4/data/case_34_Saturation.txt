   History of Present Illness
   Date: [**3067-2-25**]
   Initial visit
   Events / History of present illness: - Femoral line placed and Arterial
   line placed
   - CTA showed no PE, but +L pneumothorax with rib fractures; was
   hypotensive on pressors, surgery attempted to place chest tube and was
   not able to [**3-4**] heart size and adhesions; IP contact[**Name (NI) **]- also unable;
   instead went to IR to placed chest tube, but new CT no longer showed
   pneumo, serial CXRs without new pneumo
   - head CT- wet read of no acute intracranial process
   - hypoxia- given nebs; vent adjusted for ARDS setting, pulm consulted,
   PEEP increased, esophageal balloon placed; then pressures dropped to
   60s with PEEP of 20 and required 3 pressers; then PEEP changed to 12,
   BP improved, was able to wean neo; [**3058**]-PEEP increased to 16 due to
   lack of difference between peak and plataeu pressures in effort to
   recruit more aveoli;
   - CT also showed likely right sided aspiration; temp of 102 at 1400,
   cultures sent, pt started on zosyn, given 500ml bolus NS x 2 when
   hypotensive, new leukocytosis of 13.9; at 10pm vanco started (hx of 2
   yo with recent MRSA infection); still febrile at MN, given tylenol,
   reordered blood cxs this AM
   - continuing on amiodarone, having intermitent NSVT, short runs, less
   now then yesterday
   - CE trended- Trop-T: <0.01  CK: 267  MB: 6 to CK: 262  MB: 7  Trop-T:
   0.36, to CK 740, MB 9, trop 0.30
   - K of 6 at 20:45, rechecked at 6.2, EKG with no p-waves seen, given 2g
   Calcium gluconate, albuterol, 10 units of R insulin, 1 amp of D50,
   Kayexalate 45g; P waves reappeared on tele
   - new renal failure, decreased urine output, Cr of 2.3
   - 2400- tachy to 120- given 500 ml bolus, improved to low 100s
   - 0320 pt is tachy to 130s, SBP in 80s, first had 3 beats NSVT then
   axis changed, temp 101, 250ml NS bolus started; appeared to be in VT,
   gave amio bolus of 300mg, K of 5.3, ABG of 7.35/40/66/23/-3. Rate
   decreased to 90s. Ionized Ca was 1.09- gave addtional 2gm calcium
   gluconate
   - decreased oxygen sats in 80s, given lasix 10mg IV with no increase in
   UO, CXR at 420AM appears to have increased edema, gave lasix 20mg IV x
   1
   -500 pt in VT at rate of upper 110s- gave amio 150mg and increased rate
   from 0.5 to 1, returned to slower rhythm
   -did not respond to lasix, gave 40IV x 1
   -nimbex started

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   39M w/ pmh of ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of natural history of ebstein
   anomaly.  Currently receiving amiodarone IV, remains in sinus
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated, likely
   related to CPR and cardioversion. This AM had sevarel episodes of what
   may have been VT with rate in 120s to 130s, improved with amio bolus
   and increased gtt (however, now also increased LFTs).
   -consider lidocaine gtt if returns to VT
   -continue amiodarone gtt for now, but consider changing medication [**3-4**]
   LFTs
   -electrophysiology consult
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Difficulty oxygenating with Fi02 100% and
   increased PEEP. Per report patient had significant aspiration during
   intubation. PE ruled out with CTA.  CT initially showed left
   pneumothorax, but f/u CT showed resolution after chest tube attempt.
   Also CT and CXRs showing right sided possible aspiration PNA. Being
   ventilated according to ARDS net protocol.
   -Giving lasix this AM at increased dose to improve saturation.
   -ARDS net protocol
   -starting nimbex as paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   -nebs
   -if still poor saturation, will consider inhaled nitro
   -pulm following- ap[** Location **]te recs
   .
   #Hypotension: Initially secondary to ventricular tachycardia, and
   response to sedatives s/p intubation.  Initially on three pressers but
   now only on levo, still requiring dopa intermittently.  Will try to
   minimize PEEP to maximize venous return. may possibly be from
   decompensated heart failure.  Likely has combination of cardiogenic
   shock and septic shock.
   -pressors as needed
   -fluids as neded
   -would benefit from swan ganz catheter to better understand type of
   hypotenision
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- likely aspiration PNA
   - continue vanco and zosyn, day 2
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair. Will hold
   metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and digoxin in setting of hypotension.
   -hold metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, digoxin
   -echo today
   .
   # ARF: Cr increased to 2.6. Likely [**3-4**] hypotension. Possible ATN. Low
   UO
   - monitor UO
   - send urine lytes
   - consider renal consult
   .
   # Transaminitis: LFTs increased, may be from shock liver, and/or CHF
   - monitor liver function
   - may need to stop amio
   .
   # Family dynamicis: family concerned about care of pt in the hosptial
   - social work consult
   - likely benefit from family meeting today
   .
   #Gout: holding allopurinol and colchicine
   .
   FEN:
   ACCESS: right femoral line
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, sub q heparin
   CODE: Presumed full
   DISPO: CCU for now
