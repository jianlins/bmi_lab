Chief Complaint:  transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 3634**] hospital with
   respiratory failure [**3-3**] severe PNA,  s/p tracheostomy
   HPI:
   85 y/o M h/o CAD s/p CABG, dCHF, CRI, AFib on coumadin, CHB s/p pacer,
   CLL transferred from [**Male First Name (un) 2172**] s/p tracheostomy for management of
   respiratory failure and septic shock. According to reports he was in
   St. [**Doctor Last Name 37**] with his wife where they live part of the year when he
   suffered a fall.  Following that he had progressive dyspnea.  He
   presented to the local hospital [**2570-7-31**] where he had a chest xray that
   showed complete white out of the left lung.  He was seen by the
   surgical consultant in the ED who performed a thoracotomy and chest
   tube placement with a small amount of red blood.  CT scan was
   reportedly suggestive of a hemothorax.  His VS at that time were T 97
   BP 85/49 WBC 5.2 Hgb 8.6 PLT 106 PTT 28.2 INR 1.49  Na 136 K4.2 AST 22
   ALT 32 CKMB 1.6 Trop <0.05  ABG 7.5 pCO2 32.7 PO2 63, BUN 25 creat
   2.4.  Chest CT from [**2570-8-2**] reportedly with complete opacification of
   the left lung with air bronchograms.  Findings suggestive of extensive
   pneumonic consolidation vs malignancy.   According to physician notes
   felt most likely to be hemothorax [**3-3**] pneumonia with supratheraputic
   INR of 4.4.
   .
   He was subsequently transferred to a hospital in [**Male First Name (un) 2172**] on [**2570-8-1**]
   for treatment by a pulmonologist.  He was treated with levophed,
   imipenem/cilastin, vancomycin, Intropin?. He was mechanically
   ventilated with settings CMV 50% 500 20 7.   During his course he had
   bronchoscopy which showed LL atelctasis and pneumonia.  He had an Echo
   [**2570-8-8**] which showed EF 60%, dilated left atrium, mild MR, trivial TR,
   calcific aortic valve, severe LV diastolic dysfunction, no pericardial
   effusion, no intracardiac thrombus.  On [**2570-8-14**] he had tracheostomy
   given severity of underlying lung process.  Levophed was weaned
   starting on [**2570-8-14**].  CXR from [**2570-8-16**] reportedly showed bilateral
   perihilar and basal opacities with obscuration of the diaphragm and
   costophrenic angles most likely pleural effusion.  On [**2570-8-17**] he was
   transfused 10 units platelets.  Sputum CX from [**8-14**] with [**Female First Name (un) 176**]
   albicans, urine culture from [**8-18**] with 10,000 [**Female First Name (un) 176**].  Blood culture
   [**8-15**] with no growth.  Labs on [**8-16**] with Vanco T 29.6, [**8-18**] WBC 15.2 HCT
   26.3 PLT 55, creatinine 1.4, BUN 85, Na 149, CL 129, CO2 19.
   .
   During his [**Hospital 3636**] transfer to [**Hospital1 52**] his V/S were stable with blood
   pressure 112/46 - 135/69, uneventful per report.

   85 y/o M h/o CAD s/p CABG, dCHF, CRI, AFib on coumadin, CHB s/p pacer,
   CLL, s/p tracheostomy transferred for management of respiratory failure
   and septic shock.
   .
   #Resp Failure - s/p tracheostomy; records incomplete but suspect
   hypoxic resp failure in the setting of septic shock, airway collapse;
   bronchoscopy revealed friable airways, bronchomalacia, mucous, old
   blood; also consider cardiogenic shock in light of PMH but appears
   intravascularly volume depleted with preserved LV fxn by echo and
   fairly clear R lung field on CXR; also recurrent lymphoma or another
   primary malignancy remains on DDx (had bloody tap [**6-6**])
   -cont. full vent support AC 500/20/5; wean FiO2 to maintain sats>92%,
   PO2 > 80
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -consider dx/tx thoracentesis if left lung field does not improve
   -cycle CE's
   -albuterol nebs PRN
   .
   #Septic shock - BP did not respond to 3L NS, levophed started, a-line
   placed; presumed [**3-3**] PNA based on CXR, OSH records; bronch findings c/w
   severe hemorrhagic aspiration PNA (does have bad dentition); also
   consider line sepsis or translocation of skin flora; less likely GI/GU
   source; was treated with high-dose steroids @ OSH then apparently
   stopped abruptly, which may be contributing to HoTN
   -LR boluses to maintain CVP 8-10
   -titrate levophed to maintain MAP>65; holding antiHTN meds
   -vanco/meropenem for broad empiric cov'g
   -hydrocort 100 mg IV q8h
   -follow DIC labs
   -when stable, place new central line and d/c old line, send for Cx
   -blood, urine, BAL GS/Cx pending
   -dress skin wounds
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - unclear etiology; no EKG changes
   -kayexelate 30 g x 1
   .
   #Hypernatremia - free H20 deficit ~ 3L; will correct [**1-31**] in 24 hrs
   -D5W 1.5 L x 70 cc/hr x 24 hr.
   .
   #CAD - elev. troponin but MB WNL, no EKG changes, suspect demand in the
   setting of poor CrCl
   -trend CE's
   -cont ASA
   -systemic anticoagulation not indicated at this time
   .
   #AFib -
   -holding B-blocker in the setting of HoTN
   -holding coumadin as low level of likely dysfunctional platelets
   .
   #CHF
   -holding diuretics, afterload reducers [**3-3**] HoTN
   .
   CKD - Cr @ b/l
   -cont. to trend

   -T&S
   -guaiac stools
   -x-fuse for <24%
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia - appears chronic, but at high risk for DIC
   -cont. to trend plts, fibrinogen, d-dimer
   -x-fuse for s/sx bleeding or plts < 30
   .
   #CLL - leukocytosis likely in the setting of severe infection;
   lymphocytosis is chronic,
   -consider onc C/S re: cell counts, aranesp, possibility of
   recurrence/new primary in lung
   .
   #Sedation
   -fentanyl boluses PRN; may need versed gtt if agitated

   Patient seen and case reviewed in detail with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], whose excellent
   note reflects my thoughts. Briefly, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3635**] is an 85M c CAD, CRI,
   AF, CLL and chronic lung disease who is transferred from PR after a
   long hospital course c/b PNA, resp failure and septic shock following a
   fall. On arrival, hypotensive and in respiratory distress, bronch with
   evidence of severe necrotic PNA and L lung collapse. Fluid resuscitated
   and weaned off pressors overnight. Currently, intubated and sedated on
   A/C vent 500x12 c 5 PEEP and FiO2 0.5 with SPB 110 and paced rhythm at
   60 with occasional native beats. O/P dry, skin with diffuse weeping and
   purpura. Decreased L BS with kyphosis and limited CW excursion. RRR
   s1s2, abd soft, 3+ pitting edema. CXR minimally changed post bronch
   with L whiteout. Labs notable for evolving NSTEMI and cr 1.5. Na 156,
   WBC 30K.
   A/P
 85M with multiple comorbidities and severe pneumonia. Will
   continue broad spectrum abx, vent support, fluid and free water
   resuscitation. Start HC 100 Q8 and change CVL ASAP. Echo and cards
   eval, hold heparin for now. Above d/w wife, son and team in detail.
   Patient is critically ill, total time 60 minutes.
