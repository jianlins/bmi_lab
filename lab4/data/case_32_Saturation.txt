 HEADACHE
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   80 year old woman with pmh significant for chronic systolic congestive
   heart failure, presenting with shortness of breath.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: History and
   presentation consistent with CHF exacerbation. LVEF 20%, BNP 26,000 on
   admission. Lung exam with crackles. Unclear etiology, dietary
   indescretion and medicaiton non-compliance are likely not causes given
   patient is presenting from [**Hospital **] rehab.  Possible upper respiratory
   infection, possible worsening valvular disease. Uncontrolled
   hypertension is also a possibility. Ischemia is also a possibility.
   -diurese with lasix 40mg IV
   -trend cardiac enzymes
   -goal I/O neg 1L
   -continue metoprolol
   -continue losartan
   -will place PICC, to allow easier lasix administration while at [**Hospital **]
   rehab.
   .
   #Respiratory Status: Patient is breathing comfortablky on CPAP, PEEP
   5Oxygen saturation 98% on FiO2 50%. Per report in ED, attempts at
   weaning off CPAP to venti mask were unsuccessful secondary to marked
   tachypnea to 40's.  recent ABG with adequate oxygenation, and CO2 49.
   [**Month (only) 47**] need to increase pressure support.
   -trend ABG
   -wean off Bipap
   .
   #CAD: History of MI in [**2514**]. Will continue aspirin, lopressor, and
   losartan.
   .
   #Peripheral Vascular Disease: S/p bypass.  will continue aspirin.  Will
