Chief Complaint:  Dyspnea
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6960**] is a 68 year old female with a history of dilated
   cardiomyopathy with resolution on recent ECHO, htn, DM2 who presents
   with SOB.  She states that her SOB started acutely last night at ~ 8 pm
   and was associated with lightheadedness. It began after going to the
   mailbox to get the mail and did not begin until she sat down.  She also
   had an episode of prolonged coughing which was minimally productive of
   greenish sputum at the same time. She denies any prior SOB or DOE
   although she does note chronic orthopnea. She does note increased LE
   swelling over the last month. She notes her regular weight it 215 lbs
   and her weight on ICU admission is 240 lbs (she was 212 lbs on [**2920-10-25**]
   sleep visit). She denies any significant cough prior to last night.
   She denies fevers but does note chills for the last month. She also
   notes urinary frequency for the last month but denies dysuria.  Last
   night, her SOB improved after 30 minutes of rest.  She felt better this
   am but then had dyspnea while going through her mail and her HHA felt
   she looked SOB when she got to the house so she hit her medic alert
   necklace and was brought to the ED. She also notes bilateral calf pain,
   R worse than L.
   .
   In the ED, 97.9, 72, 127/85, 20, 93% RA. Labs remarkable for normal WBC
   count, Hct at 33 within recent baseline, electrolytes were normal with
   exception of BUN/Cr 26/1.1 (BL Cr 0.9-1.0, CEs were negative x 1.
   Lactate was 2.4. CXR showed possible L hilar consolidation. U/A
   consistent with UTI. She received 1 gram of ceftriaxone and 750 mg of
   levofloxacin. Her BPs transiently dropped to SBPs in 80s which resolved
   to 1 L of NS with increase in SBPs to 110s.  She received an additional
   L of NS following this drop.  At the time of transfer to the ICU, her
   SBP was in the 120s.  Also of note, her ECG showed weinkeboch at a rate
   in the 50s which was new compared to prior.  Cardiology was consulted
   with the ED and did not think any further intervention was required.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, patient is in NAD. She feels comfortable. She
   denies any significant SOB.  She denies any current or recent chest
   pain.  She does note calf pain bilaterally which has been chronic. As
   above she denies fevers but does not chills x 1 month. Denies any
   nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria. She
   does note urinary frequency.
   On admission to the ICU it was noted that LE edema was non-symmteric
   where R leg was slightly more edematous than the L leg.  Pt underwent
   U/S which showed a R popliteal venous thrombus.  At that point pt was
   started on a heparin drip.  Through first night pt's symptoms persisted
   and she cont'd being SOB.  A CTA was performed and R main pul artery
   embolus was found. Heparin drip was continued and pt's symptoms
   improved through he second night where she was found to be
   symptomatically much better breathing easily with pulse ox in the high
   90s with a RR ranging from 15-20.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6960**] was then sent to the
   hospital floor.  While on the floor she developed SOB and became
   tachypneic.  She was ventilated via NRB on 4L and given nebulizer
   treatments and then transferred to the ICU.  On arrival to the unit she
   was found to be less tachypneic and saturating in the high 90s.
   Symptomaticcally she states she feels better.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Multifactorial. Given her presentation of acute shortness of
   breath, and recent weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf
   for etiology included DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to
   ischemic event or pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of
   infection other than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On
   LENIs appears to have chronic DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started
   heparin drip night of admission.  CTA shows R lung PE and evidence of R
   heart strain.  Echo with preserved EF, NL RV size and free wall motion.
   Trival MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] evidence of right heart strain. Theory is that PE is
   subacute given increasing edema over last month. Increased heart
   strain, possible UTI exacerbated strain on heart causing development of
   new arrithymia and worsening SOB.
   - f/u CTA final read
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - started coumadin 5 mg today, trend INR
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension
   - treat heart block as below
   - d/ced azithro yesterday once clear lung process [**1-6**] PE. No longer
   feel PNA likely
   - cont CPAP at night
   .
   # hypotension: Known PE as above likely contributing. Sepsis from UTI
   unlikely given no other SIRS physiology. Cardiac event unlikely given
   neg CE.. Very unlikely to be secondary to sepsis given lack of white
   count, fever and clinically stable. Also this could be somehow related
   to her bradycardia and newly diagnosed 2^nd degree heart
   block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - On CTX for possible UTI but U cult NG so far, asymptomatic. Check
   Urine sediment today given overnight R flank pain (responded to
   Tylenol), if neg d/c CTX as com[** Location **]g 3 day course anyway
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS, very preload dependent given PE.
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.  U culture NG to date
   - ceftriaxone to be stoped after neg urine sediment.
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved
   since admit with hydration overnight.
   -PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   - once BP, she may need lasix given her edema
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitis: on glipizide, raloxifene as outpt.
   - hold oral meds
   - ISS
   .
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: has been noncompliant in past with CPAP due
   to poorly fitting mask.
   - CPAP
