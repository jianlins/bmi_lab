Chief Complaint:  hypotension
   HPI:
   86 yo male with history of atrial fibrillation, s/p pacemaker placement
   on [**3261-3-31**], and known AAA was admitted from the ED with cellulitis and
   hypotension.
   Patient reports that on the morning of admission he woke up to urinate
   but was unable to stand up. He was then brought in by ambulance to the
   [**Hospital1 329**] ED. ROS was notable for the following: increased left lower
   extremity swelling, erythema, and tenderness x 3 weeks for which he has
   been taking increased doses of lasix. Reivew of systems was otherwise
   unremarkable. Denies feeling lightheaded, dizzy, SOB, chest pain, loss
   of consciousness, diarrhea, dysuria, nausea, or vomiting.
   .
   Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 329**] with temp 100, BP 78/50. HR
   and pulse ox not documented. He was started on peripheral dopamine,
   received broad spectrum antibiotics with ceftriaxone 1 g IV x 1
   andvancomycin 1g IV x 1, and received approximately 3.5-4L NS. He was
   then transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] ED, where upon arrival temp 98.3, HR 60s, BP
   114/64, RR 18, and 100% on 4L NC. He had a central line placed and was
   started on levophed.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   86 yo male with history of recent pacemaker placement on [**3261-3-31**] for
   complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension was
   admitted with fever and hypotension concerning for severe sepsis.
   PLAN:
   1. Sepsis
   Patient with evidence of severe sepsis given bandemia, hypotension, and
   acute on chronic renal failure. Source of infection includes most
   likely cellulitis but additional possibilities include urinary tract
   given innumerable bacteria. Pulmonary source appears unlikely in the
   setting of adequate O2 sat with minimal O2 supplementation. Pacer
   pocket without signs of inflammation.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - start vancomycin and ceftriaxone for broad spectrum coverage and
   concern for MRSA
   - maintain MAP > 65 with goal CVP of [**11-13**]
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency
   Patient with creatinine elevated from baseline, appears most likely
   secondary to pre-renal in the setting of hypotension and creatinine has
   already begun to improve with hydration and pressor support.
   - send urine lytes
   - consider checking renal US if creatinine doesn't continue to improve
   with improved BPs
   3. Cellulitis
   Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema, tenderness to
   palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam and no evidence
   of clear effusion of left ankle. LE US was negative for DVT.  Per
   patient report, has not taken any further antibiotics for this and was
   only taking increased lasix dosing.
   - start vancomycin for concern for MRSA given recent hospitalization
   and recent pacemaker placement
   - follow-up blood cultures
   4. Coagulopathy
   Patient with elevated INR of unclear etiology. Differential includes
   most likely nutritional.
   - give 5 PO Vitamin K
   5. Rheumatoid Arthritis
   Stable
   - continue Enbrel per outpatient
   6. Hypertension
   Patient with a history of hypertension but now clearly with hypotension
   likely in the setting of infection.
   - holding ant-HTN in the setting of severe sepsis
   - hold lasix
   7. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue eye drops
   8. BPH
   History of BPH in the past and on terazosin as an outpatient.
   - hold terazosin in the setting of hypotension
   9. Pancytopenia
   Patient with a history of pancytopenia and possibly with a diagnosis of
   myelodysplastic syndrome. All counts appear within range of recent
   hospitalization.
   - obtain further information from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue B12
   10. Osteoporosis
   Stable
   - continue fosamax, calcium, and Vitamin D
   11. Tremor
   Stable
   - continue Primidone per outpatient regimen
