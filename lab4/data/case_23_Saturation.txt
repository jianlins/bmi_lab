Date of service: [**3366-1-22**]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Chest pain, Claudication, (Other: CCU admit for
   agitation following complicated coronary and peripheral
   catheterization)
   History of present illness: Please see [**Hospital1 2208**] admission note for further
   details. This note will incorporate pertinent past cardiac and
   interventional studies from their note.
   In brief, this is a 53 y/oF with significant past cardiac history s/p
   CABG who was admitted under the [**Hospital1 2208**] service on [**3366-1-19**] for cardiac and
   peripheral catheterization given DOE, recent chest pain, and
   claudication.
   She underwent catheterization for planned RCA stenting and exernal
   iliac stenting. Access was initiated through the left groin but
   complicated by dissection that was treated with angioplasty.
   Angiography showed prox 70% tubular lesion with flow into LCx, RCA had
   90% stenosis at origin.
   The patient developed a cold left leg in the post-cath holding area
   following the procedure and was returned to the cath lab where she was
   found to have a popliteal occlusion. She had a left SFA stent and
   attempted embolectomy, but ultimately treated with popliteal stent. She
   left the cath lab with palpable pulses on the left side and dopplerable
   pulse in the PT, none in the DP.
   In the CCU, she was transfused overnight, developed worsening hypoxia
   with room air sats in the high 80s, requiring 4L of NC to maintain O2
   sats of 95. Complained of ongoing back pain and nausea, which both
   occurred following her past procedures. The back pain was not
   characteristically different from prior. She was markedly agitated as
   noted by housestaff and nurses, requiring supervision to ensure that
   she does not try to induce emesis by stimulating gag reflex.
   She presently denies chest pain, but does have worsening shortness of
   breath.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o Female with premature and severe coronary artery disease and
   peripheral vascular disease s/p RCA, R iliac stents c/b dissection of
   left SFA down to popliteal resulting in ischemic limb managed with
   recatheterization with stenting.
   #) Coronary Artery Disease
    - BMS (Vision) to RCA
    - Continue plavix, aspirin dual antiplatelet therapy
    - Continue risk management strategies including statin and BP agents
   #) Ischemic Left Limb following femoral artery dissection
    - Managed with stenting of popliteal occlusion after unable to perform
   thrombectomy
    - Follow pulses closely in left let
    - Duplex ultrasound in am to evaluate flow, bruit
   #) Right Puncture site/Migrated Angioseal
    - Ultrasound in AM of right femoral artery to assess for
   pseudoaneurysm, location of angioseal
   #) Peripheral Vascular Disease
    - Interval stenting of Right External Iliac
    - Will discuss amonst team if further peripheral intervention/bypass
   would be required for claudication, though this may be temporized by
   percutaneous intervention.
   #) Mechanical Valves (AV, MV)
    - Continue anticoagulation with heparin, aim to keep PTT between
   50-60.
    - Can likely restart warfarin dosing tonight as recommended by cath
   team, and hold further doses if additional interventions are necessary
    - Monitor groin for signs of bleeding.
   #) Hypoxia:
   -          Worsening o2 sats with dyspnea in the setting of
   transfusion. Concern for TACO or TRALI, though this does appear to be a
   gradual change.
   -          Checking CXR to assess for medistinal changes, interstitial
   processes that would suggest we should stop the blood transfusion that
   is in progress (though needed).
   #) Hypertension
   - Patient with widened pulse pressure and hypotension upon admission to
   the hospital, not with exacerbation of those (otherwise not [** Location **]usly
   noted to have this significant of a pulse pressure in outpatient record
   190s/60s.
   - Nitro as needed for SBP>180
   - Pain/Agitation Control
   - Repeat echocardiogram to asses valves.
   #) Agitation
    - [**Doctor First Name 1895**], her husband, notes that she commonly becomes agitated from a
   combination of being supine with her bad back, but this does appear to
   go beyond simple pain into a component of delirium given calling out
   for parents and paranoia. Apparently per husband has paradoxic
   reactions to haloperidol, so will treat with lorazepam as needed, which
   may also help with next problem, nausea.
   #) Nausea
    - Also pt apparently has history of severe nausea after
   catheterization procedures, so this is not unusual for her. Given RCA
   procedure, we would consider coronary complications that would lead to
   nausea, but ECG does not have any changes in inferior territory and
   other changes are not specific. Will be checking post-cath CK, CK-MB
   for f/u.  Manage with zofran, ativan.
   - Check KUB
   #) Back Pain
    - Notable pieces of history include RP bleed in the past, but patient
   has known, severe, chronic back pain and does not have a significant
   HCT drop or change in heart rate, or changes on physical exam that
   would be concerning for RP complication from procedure at this time.
   This is most likely combination of missing her high doses of oxycontin
   which she takes at home, and being supine on the table.
   - Continue oxycontin,
   - hydromorphone 2mg IV q2-4h for breakthrough
   #) Iron Deficiency Anemia
   - Continue Iron, being transfused today 2 units this evening
   #) Hemolytic Anemia
   -          Likely component of hemolysis from mechanical valves as
   evidenced by pretransfusion low haptoglobin.

   Dispo: CCU pending improvement in BP, agitation.
   Discussed case with interventional fellows, CCU covering fellow.
   ------ Protected Section ------
   ADDENDUM: Laboratory results received, Hgb 8, HCT 29, notable for
   dissociation between values. CXR shows some mild interstitial,
   reticular pattern. Discussed with radiology, who also cross-referenced
   with her CT from 08 which showed mild interstitial edema at bases.
   Given the subacute nature of her oxygen saturation decline (she was low
   90s in cath lab), I do not at this time think that this is a
   transfusion related lung injury, but rather likely mild interstitial
   edema from slight volume overload. Will try lasix 10mg IV x1 to help
   with pressure and hypoxia, monitor urine output.
