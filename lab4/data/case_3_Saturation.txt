Chief Complaint:  Lower gastrointestinal bleed, hypoxia
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3905**] is a 71yo female with PMH significant for ESRD on HD,
   respiratory failure, who presents from HD with BRBPR. Patient was at HD
   earlier this morning and was noted to have 400cc BRBPR. She was also
   hypotensive and HD was stopped. Her blood pressure was 118/80 before
   her BP dropped. It is unclear what her BP or how much fluid was removed
   at this time. Per NH records, she had quaiac positive BM last night.
   While in transport to the ED, she sounded extremely congested per EMS
   reports.
   In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.1 BP 80/70 AR 80 RR 24 O2 sat 70%
   on 50% flowmask. She was placed on 95% high flow mask and her oxygen
   saturation increased to 99%. She was noted to have thick, creamy
   looking secretions. Given improvement in her O2 sat, the FIO2 was
   decreased to 0.50. She received Protonix 80mg IV and 1L NS bolus. She
   was then transferred to the MICU for further management.
   Home medications: Combivent MDI, Aluminum hydroxide gel, Aspirin 81mg
   PO daily, Chlorhexidine gluconate, Vitamin B-12 monthly, Colace 100mg
   PO BID, Flonase, folate, heparin SQ [**Hospital1 **],  Levothyroxine, Lidocaine

   Assessment and Plan:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3905**] is a 71yo female with PMH significant
   for ESRD on HD, anemia, respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy who is
   being transferred to the MICU for LGIB.
   1)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD. Per
   her PMH, she has a history of GI bleeding but no additional information
   is know at this time. Differential for LGIB includes hemmoroids,
   diverticuliosis, angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemia, IBD,
   and neoplasm. No report of fevers, chills, or diarrhea to suggest an
   infectious colitis or IBD. Also, IBD would be unusual to present for
   the first time in a 71yo woman. She has no prior history of CAD to
   suggest ischemic colitis. Most likely diverticulitis vs. hemorrhoids.
   Per OMR, she has not had a colonoscopy here. Her baseline Hct is
   between 25-30 but her Hct on admission today of 35.5. Her INR and PTT
   are elevated today.  She is on Aspirin as an outpatient but is not on
   any anti-coagulation (in light of history of atrial fibrillation).
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - 2 PIVs in place
   - GI consult; consider colonoscopy
   - Hold ASA
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse if Hct<25
   - If PTT remains significantly elevated, consider Protamine
   2)Hypotension:  Patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBPs in 80
   possibly lower at dialysis. Unclear how much fluid was removed at
   dialysis. She also had 400cc of BRBPR which may be accounting for her
   transient hypotension.  She received 1L NS in the ED and her BP quickly
   stabilized and remains at baseline. No fevers or chills to suggest an
   underlying infectious process.  Lactate was elevated to 3.9 but this
   was in the setting of renal failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Repeat lactate
   3)Respiratory: Patient has history of respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy and was successfully weaned in [**11-27**]. Patient was acutely
   hypoxic with O2 saturation between 50-70%. She was also noted to have
   increased secretions; she likely mucous plugged given acute
   desaturation. Her Upon transfer to the MICU, her respiratory status
   stabilized.  She is currently on 50% trachmask.  No evidence of a
   pneumonia on cxray.
   - Check ABG
   - Sputum cx
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   4)Coagulopathy: Patient presents with elevated INR and PTT. She is not
   on any anti-coagulation or blood thinners as outpatient. These labs may
   have been draw via a line that was flushed with heparin. This may also
   be due to heparin SQ she has been receiving at home.
   - Repeat coags
   5)ESRD on HD: Patient underwent dialysis today but prematurely stopped
   in the setting of BRBPR. Her BP during this time dropped and remained
   below baseline upon transfer to the ED.
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   6)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   7)Anemia: Baseline Hct between 25-30. Hct on admission was 35, which is
   slightly elevated from baseline.  She receives Epogen at HD.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend daily Hct
   8)Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 71F ESRD on HD, colon cancer, COPD /
   aspiration c/b T+G [**11-27**] p/w BRBPR at HD with drop in SBP to 80s. Desat
   in ED to 70% requiring aggressive suctioning, now c SPB 110 and sat 99%
   on 40% TM.
   Exam notable for Tm 96.8 BP 110/62 HR 78 RR 18 with sat 99% on 40%TM.
   Trach with thick secretions, clear lungs without rales, RRR s1s2 [**1-26**] SM
   at base. G-tube intact, no abd tend, stasis changes. Labs notable for
   WBC 10K, HCT 31%.
   Agree with plan to consult GI re bowel prep, continue to monitor serial
   HCT, maintain IV access and BBS, keeping HCT >25%. Would consider RBC
   scan / angio for brisk bleeding, otherwise hope to prep for colonoscopy
   in AM. Will hold HSC and recheck PTT given PTT >150. Will check ABG now
   and cx sputum; remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 70 minutes.
