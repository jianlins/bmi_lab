Clinician:  Attending
   55 yr old with severe PVD, CAD with EF 20%, ESRD, chronic hep C, DM, 50
   py ex-smoker, s/p right AKA and left BKA, admitted with non-healing
   gangrenous ulcerations of both hands, requiring left brachial to radial
   bypass on [**3276-12-8**]. Had large vol paracentesis (4.1 L) also on [**12-8**]
   c/b brady, hypotension, demand ischemia and unresponsiveness requiring
   intubation and pressors.
   This AM, was noted to lethargic, desat to 88% on 3L. Had diagnostic
   para which showed 7K wbc, 28K rbc, c/w SBP. Was already on vanc, given
   dose of ceftriaxone.  Received 50 g albumin x 2 today, last time about
   6pm. Although mentating well, appeared somnolent. ABG was obtained -
   acute resp acidosis with pCO2 88.
   NPPV was attempted but pt required intubation and ventilation. Because
   of persistent hypercapnia, switched to PC ventilation. Currently PC 33
   cm, peep 12, FiO2 100%. Most recent VBG 7.26/59. Sats ~94-98%. There is
   no obvious CHF on [** Location **]tubation CXR. Reduced breath sounds on left,
   scant wheeze, heart sounds distant, abd distended. Difficult to obtain
   ABGs. CXR notable for atelectasis +/- large effusion on left.
   Labs notable for Hct 30, wbc 8.0, 80% polys, no bands, INR 1.3, K 5.0,
   creat 3.5, vanc level 21.6. Last pO2 on ABG 94 on 100% FiO2. Micro - 3
   sets BC, urine, ascites sent today. Multiple cdiffs negative.
   Impression - altered MS and subsequent hypotension likely due to SBP.
   Acute respiratory failure is likely related to a combination of
   atelectasis of LLL, probable left sided pleural effusion, +/- volume
   overload in the setting of getting albumin and not being dialysed x 2
   days, and fatigue.
   He now has a tense abdomen and bladder pressure of 20 cm. BP has
   improved without need for pressors. Will proceed with therapeutic
   thoracentesis, try to obtain femoral a-line, agree with Vanc/Zosyn,
   follow up on cultures. Will likely need to resite the central line
   which was placed on the floor. Scheduled for HD in AM.
   Rest of the plan as outlined in Dr[**Name (NI) 10728**] note.
   Total time spent:  80 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.
   Paracentesis performed: I was present during entire procedure. Approx
   1.7 L of ascites removed. No complications. Tidal volumes improved with
   Ve increasing from 12 to 17 L on current vent settings. Bladder
   pressure decreased to 16. ABG pending.
