Date of service: [**2640-11-24**]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Arrhythmia
   History of present illness: The patient is an 86 y.o. male with pmh
   significant for CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in [**2636**], chronically
   occluded RCA with L->R collaterals, dilated cardiomyopathy of [**9-2**]%
   presenting to his outpatient Cardiologist with several weeks of
   lethargy, and found to be bradycardic with HR in the 30's.  EKG in
   office showed Junctional bradycardia at a rate of 30, blood pressure
   60/palp.  He was given atropine 2mg with increased Hr to 40's, and then
   transferred to the ED.  In the ED his HR remained in the 30-40's with
   blood pressure of 110/50.  He developed an increased oxygen requirement
   with O2 saturation 60-70% on NRB.  Head CT was performed to rule out
   CVA as cause of bradycardia and was found to be negative for acute
   bleed.  Patient was also found to be in acute renal failure with
   creatinine of 5.5 from baseline 2.5. His potassium was also initially
   found to elevated at 9.0 in a hemolyzed sample. Repeat K was 5.0.
   Diqoxin level was found to be 0.7.  Repeat K was 5.0.  Given his
   progressive hypoxia he was intubated with O2 saturation of 100% on FiO2
   100%.  In the ED his rhythm alternated between sinus and junctional
   bradycardia.
   His vitals were HR 37-39, blood pressure (77-116)/(33-46).  He was
   given aspirin, atropine, sodium bicarbonate, insulin 10 units, an amp
   of D50, albuterol nebs.
   Per medical records, the patient has been hospitalized several times in
   the past for both acute on chronic congestive heart failure and acute
   renal failure attributed to poor forward flow from CHF. he was most
   revcently admitted from [**2640-10-15**] through [**2640-10-22**], during which he was
   diuresed 10L in the CCU on a lasix drip with BP support from milrinone
   and phenylephrine. Upon discharge, bumex was added and torsemide was
   discontinued.  On [**11-10**] the patient had increased creatinine detected
   on routine labs, which resulted in a decrease of his bumex from 4mg to
   3mg PO BID.  He then experienced a 5lb increased weight gain and had
   his bumex increased to 4mg PO BID on [**2640-11-20**].
   .
   Per wife, patient has had increased confusion over past three days, in
   addition to abdominal pain and diahrrea.

   Tests
   ECG: (Date: [**2639-11-24**]), Junctional Bradycardia with leftward axis and
   occasional ventricular escape rhythm.  ST T-wave changes at baseline
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2640-10-17**]), The left atrium is dilated. A mass is
   seen in the body of the left atrium. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   15-20%). Diastolic function could not be assessed. The right
   ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
   mildly dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets
   cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area
   0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
   appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
   gradients. The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: There appears to be a mass in the body of the left atrium.
   It appears to be attached to the posterior wall. This may be a tumour,
   thrombus or an artifact from the prosthetic mitral valve. It has been
   present, with a similar size on echocardiograms on [**2-17**]/8 and 11/18/8.
   It was also seen on a cardiac MRIon [**2639-8-13**]. A TEE could be done to
   further clarify, if indicated.
   Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis.
   Moderate to severe aortic stenosis and mild to moderate aortic
   regurgitation. Normally functioning mitral prosthesis. Mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension.
   Stress Testing: (Date: [**2639-6-7**]), (Protocol: persantine), (Duration: 4
   minutes), ETT: [**2639-6-7**]:
   INTERPRETATION: The patient is an 85 yo male with a history of afib,
   HTN, CHF EF 10%, MVR, and known CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX
   referred for CAD evaluation, pre-op cardiac assessment for cataract
   surgery. The patient received 0.142 mg/kg/min of persantine over 4
   minutes. The patient reported no chest,back,or arm discomfort. EKG
   showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block at baseline. There
   were no ST-T wave changes during infusion of persantine or recovery.
   Rhythm was sinus with occasional PVCs. The patient received 125 mg
   aminophylline IV to reverse persantine.
   IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes or anginal symptoms. Nuclear report
   sent separately.
   .
   Nuclear report:
   IMPRESSION: 1. No reversible perfusion defects. 2. Fixed inferior wall
   defect.
   3. Markedly dilated left ventricle. 4. Diffuse hypokinesis. 5. EF 17%
   Ventilator: CMV 500/12, PEEP 5, FiO2 .40
   Assessment and Plan
   86M w/ pmh CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF 15%, presenting with
   junctional bradycardia, hypoxia, hypothermia, with stable blood
   pressure.
   .
   #Bradycardia: Fluctuating between sinus and junctional bradycardia, in
   the setting of hypoxia, hypothermia, and acute renal failure.  MI is
   also a possibility for bradycardia, with elevated troponin, however
   patient is also in ARF and  ekg is not showing ischemic changes from
   baseline.  The patient was maintaining a MAP > 60 in the ED, however is
   currently now  55.  EP following, may request pace maker to maintain HR
   in setting of beta blockade for ischemic cardiomyopathy. No indication
   for temporary pacing given other metabolic causes for bradycardia.
   -peripheral dopamine to maintain MAP> 60.
   -intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure
   -bear hugger for hypothermia
   -Pacer pads on
   -sputum, blood, urine Cx.
   -vanc and zosyn, broad coverage given low MAP and recent
   hospitalizations.
   -trending cardiac enzymes
   -holding on A-line secondary to supratherapeutic INR 7.9.
   -holding metoprolol
   -holding digoxin
   .
   #Hypotension: Current MAP is 55. Recent vitals from outpatient records
   show baseline BP 95/40. Hypotension secondary to systolic congestive
   heart failure, exacerbated by unidentified infetion.  Holding on
   Arterial line and central line in setting of INR 7.9.
   -fluid boluses, dopamine
   -pan culture
   -vanc, zosyn
   .
   #Respiratory Status:Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure in ED,
   was 70% on NRB.  CXR with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of CHF. Will
   not diurese in setting of hypotension. currently oxygenating well on
   FiO2 100%
   -wean down FiO2, PEEP
   .
   #Acute renal failure: Cr 5.5, up from baseline of 2.5. Could be
   secondary to overdiuresis given recent increase of bumex.  Could also
   be secondary to exacerbation of congestive heart failure and low
   cardiac output.  Renal following, no need for CVVH or HD.
   -U lytes
   -UA
   -keep MAP > 55, w/ dopamine and IVF
   .
   #Hypothermia: possibly from infection. Wife reporting three days of
   confusion, abdominal pain and diahrrea. will pan culture and cover with
   broad spectrum abx.  Lactate 2.5.
   -blood, sputum, urine cx
   -stool for C.Diff
   -vancomycin, zosyn
   .
   #Supratherapeutic INR: No new medications to suggest medication
   interactions which could increase INR.  No new antibiotics. Unsure
   etiology, will hold coumadin and monitor DIC labs.
   -Pt, PTT, fibrinogen
   -Vitamin K
   -holding on procedures
   -FFP for urgent INr reversal
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in [**2636**], and
   chronically occluded RCA with L->R collaterals.  ekg not showing new
   ischemic changes, will trend enzymes. Received aspirin in ED.
   -continue aspirin
   .
   # PUMP:History of dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to ischemia, LVEF
   17%. CXR with bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema. CHF
   exacerbation likely caused by bradycardia.  Bradycardia likely resulted
   from infection and acute renal failure.
   -holding diuresis
   -holding metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM:Currently in junctional rhythm, alternating with sinus.
   Baseline rhythm is atrial flutter. Holding digoxin and metoprolol, will
   consider temporary pacing in setting of hypotension.
   .
   #Bullous Pemphigoid: recently placed on sarna, hydroxyzine, and
   minocycline by dermatology for pruritic rash over abdomen.  Biopsy
   results showed bullous pemphigoid.  Will continue with sarna, but will
   hold minocycline and hydroxyzine in setting of acute illness.
   -sarna
   -hold minocycline, hydroxyzine
   .
   #PPX: Supratherapeutic INR for DVT prophylaxis, IV protonix, holding
   bowel regimen in setting of diahrrea.
