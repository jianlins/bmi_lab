Chief Complaint:  post-operative monitoring
   HPI:
   73 yo male with a history of bilateral renal cell carcinoma metastatic
   to the right adrenal gland was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for
   post-operative monitoring after right adrenalectomy and prostate
   biopsy.
   Patient was [** Location **]usly diagnosed with bilateral renal cell carcinoma in
   [**10-24**] and underwent right partial nephrectomy and left nephrectomy. He
   developed metastatic disease to the right adrenal in [**2967-11-20**] for
   which he received a course of sutent and temsirolimus. Patient was then
   evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 382**] in [**1-/2969**] who recommended isolated surgical
   resection of his right adrenal. He underwent right adrenalectomy in the
   OR on [**2969-3-21**]. Of note, patient also underwent prostate biopsy due to
   persistently elevated PSA.The procedure was approximately 4 hours.
   During the procedure, he received 6 liters of Lactated Ringer's
   Solution, 4 units pRBCs, and 1 unit FFP. Estimated blood loss was
   1100mL with urine output of 2750 with 20mg IV lasix given. He also had
   an epidural in place for pain control. Post-operatively he was
   extubated without difficulty and transitioned to 6L facemask prior to
   transfer.
   Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling generally well with
   [**5-30**] abdominal pain surrounding his surgical incision site. He
   otherwise denies fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain, or shortness
   of breath.

   Patient was initially diagnosed with T1b No M0 in [**2965-11-18**] after which

   ([**9-/2965**]) for a 6.5cm mass of his left kidney and 2.5cm mass of his
   right kidney. He then developed a recurrence in his right adrenal in
   [**2967-11-20**] at which time he was treated with Sutent. Unfortunately
   he developed progression of his disease in [**2968-9-19**] and was then
   started on tensirolimus in [**2968-11-19**].

   Imaging: MRI Abdomen - [**2969-2-26**] -
   1.  Large right adrenal mass with surrounding neovascularity and
   without evidence of direct invasion into the adjacent liver. Doubt
   extension into the IVC at this time. The MR appearance is non-specific,
   but, according to the provided history, this is thought to represent a
   metastatic lesion.
   2. S/p left nephrectomy.  No soft tissue abnormality to suggest local
   recurrence in the left renal bed.
   3. S/p right partial nephrectomy. Multiple small cystic foci within the
   right kidney, including one with ? septum or punctate enhancement.
   Continued surveillance is recommended.
   4.  Two subcentimeter right paraaortic lymph nodes not enlarged by size
   criteria. If possible, comparison with prior studies (none on PACs
   record) is recommended to assess for any evidence of interval growth.
   5. Two small foci identified on limited assessment of the liver.  If
   clinically indicated, dedicated MRI of the liver using BOPTA contrast
   could help to assess whether the segment VII lesion represents focal
   nodular hyperplasia and would also further characterize the high T2
   lesion in the hepatic dome. The small lesion in the dome is not fully
   characterized, but, statistically, most likely represents a small cyst
   or hemangioma.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo male with history of bilateral renal cell carcinoma metastatic to
   right adrenalectomy presents for post-operative monitoring after right
   adrenalectomy and prostate biopsy.
   PLAN:
   1. s/p right adrenalectomy
   Patient just underwent right adrenalectomy complicated by 1.1L of blood
   loss and requiring 4 units pRBCs and 6L of LR. He currently appears
   stable and with complaints only of pain.
   - continue to monitor post-operative vitals and UOP
   - continue epidural  pain service
   - ap[** Location **]te pain service recs
   2. Hypoxia
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely pulmonary edema, although
   patient has no known history of congestive heart failure. Additional
   possibilities include infection, although patient has remained afebrile
   and without cough/sputum production. Additional possibility includes PE
   given patient
s active malignancy, although would be unwilling to risk
   CTA in this patient with impaired renal function.
   - continue autodiuresis as patient has been making good urine
   - check CXR
   - hold off on antibiotics for now without fever or sputum production
   - continue to consider PE if symptoms persist or do not improve
   - consider getting an echocardiogram if symptoms do not improve
   3. Leukocytosis
   Patient with elevated WBC to 26.4 in the post-operative setting,
   although patient has remained afebrile.
   - if patient spikes, pan-culture
   - consider broad coverage with cefepime, cipro, and vancomycin if
   patient spikes
   - add on differential
   4. Hypertension
   Patient has remained normotensive after surgery.
   - will hold patient's anti-HTN given blood loss and need for 6L IVF
   with 4 units pRBCs intra-operatively.
   - consider restarting anti-HTN in the AM
   5. Renal Cell Carcinoma
   Patient with bilateral renal cell carcinoma now s/p left nephrectomy
   and partial right nephrectomy. Only known metastatic site is right
   adrenal and now s/p right adrenalectomy.
   - continue outpatient management per urology and oncology
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  NPO for now
   Glycemic Control:  adequate control for now, consider adding HISS if
   sugars are elevated
