Date of service: [**2516-12-21**]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Dyspnea
   History of present illness: 80 y.o. female with pmh significant for
   chronic systolic congestive heart failure, LVEF 20%, presenting to ED
   from nursing home after waking this morning acutely short of breath.
   The on-call physician at the nursing home gave the patient lasix 80mg
   IV, albuterol, and morphine prior to transfer. No foley was placed,
   however, upon arival to ED the patient's sheets were soaked with
   urine.  In ED, patient was tachypneic with RR in 40's and had Oxygen
   saturaiton of 88% on NRB. BNP was 26,000, CXR showed bilateral
   infiltrates. She was also hypertensive with BP 160/100 and tachycardic
   to 120's. EKG showed LBBB with lateral depressions.  She was given
   nitroglycerin and  placed on Bipap.  She responded with O2 saturation
   of 98%, respiratory rate of 16, and her blood pressure and heart rate
   decreased to 110/60 and 60-70's respectively. Her ekg changes returned
   to baseline.  Attempts were made to wean her form Bipap to NRB and
   venti mask, and were unsuccessful secondary to O2 desaturation and
   tachypnea.
   .
   The patient has had multiple CHF exacerbations recently, which have all
   been handled at [**Hospital **] rehab.  Per the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been
   decompensating somewhat with diminished PO intake.  The patient had an
   episode of shortness of breath at [**Hospital 316**] Rehab on [**12-18**] which reoslved
   with lasix 90mg IV and morphine. She was "Do Not hospitalize" status 1
   week ago, however, given the difficulty of treating her CHF
   exacerbations overnight without doctors on [**Name5 (PTitle) 1635**], it was decided to
   revoke the "DNH" status for the purposes of transferring the patient to
   the hospital in the event that an exacerbation would occur overnight
   and no MD's were avaliable to push IV lasix.

   Review of symptoms is answered by her son.  [**Name (NI) 371**] has expressive
   aphasia.
   .
   review of systems is notable for absence of fever, chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial

   mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   80 year old woman with pmh significant for chronic systolic congestive
   heart failure, presenting with shortness of breath.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: History and
   presentation consistent with CHF exacerbation. LVEF 20%, BNP 26,000 on
   admission. Lung exam with crackles. Unclear etiology, dietary
   indescretion and medicaiton non-compliance are likely not causes given
   patient is presenting from [**Hospital **] rehab.  Possible upper respiratory
   infection, possible worsening valvular disease. Uncontrolled
   hypertension is also a possibility. Ischemia is also a possibility.
   -diurese with lasix 40mg IV
   -trend cardiac enzymes
   -goal I/O neg 1L
   -continue metoprolol
   -continue losartan
   -will place PICC, to allow easier lasix administration while at [**Hospital **]
   rehab.
   .
   #Respiratory Status: Patient is breathing comfortablky on CPAP, PEEP
   5Oxygen saturation 98% on FiO2 50%. Per report in ED, attempts at
   weaning off CPAP to venti mask were unsuccessful secondary to marked
   tachypnea to 40's.  recent ABG with adequate oxygenation, and CO2 49.
   [**Month (only) 47**] need to increase pressure support.
   -trend ABG
   -wean off Bipap
   .
   #CAD: History of MI in [**2514**]. Will continue aspirin, lopressor, and
   losartan.
   .
   #Peripheral Vascular Disease: S/p bypass.  will continue aspirin.  Will
   restart plavix per discussion with PCP.

   addition to sliding scale.
   .

   .
   #Depression:continue sertraline and bupropion
   .
