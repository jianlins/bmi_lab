Chief Complaint:  Altered mental status, hypoxia
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   64 y.o. man with ESRD, ischemic CM, and colon [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 52**]
   on [**4-15**] for evaluation s/p right hip fracture. Transferred no from OMED
   floor for hypoxia and mental status changes.  Was getting a staging CTA
   earlier today and was noted to be 60% saturated on pulse ox on 4 L NC.
   Also had increasing distress and changes in mental status.  ABG
   7.25/70/43 on HFFM 8 L. at ~7 pm.  Of note, had oxycontin dose doubled
   yesterday as was requiring higher doses of morphine on PCA the day
   before.  Had been on BiPAP at home for OSA and home O2, 2 L/min NC for
   unclear reasons.  On transfer he denied chest pain but did note
   tightness when breathing.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC HYYPOXIC/HPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
         Hypercarbic respiratory failure related to history of OSA
   exacerbated by increased sedatives.  Also given hypoxia and
   infiltrates/effusions concerned about CHF vs. amiodarone-induced lung
   disease.  Also has a significant smoking history, ?underlying COPD.
   Most likely due to fluid overload, also given history of ischemic CM
   will want to rule out cardiac ischemia.  Will repeat ECG and cycle
   cardiac enzymes.  Hold sedatives for now until awake enough to take
   po
s, consider restarting oxycontin at 20 mg q day.
        BiPAP, O2
         Bronchodilators
         Consider diagnostic thorocentesis if effusions persist after
   dialysis and volume removal, ? malignant
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD).  Patient is
   anuric so cannot diurese.  Will cnsult renal service for planned
   dialysis tomorrow.  Continue
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR).  Pain management as
   above.  Ortho consult tomorrow regarding any further intervention to
   stablize albeit likely not.  Follow-up on biopsy at [**Hospital1 172**].
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC.  Ruling out for MI as
   above.  ASA.
 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II.  Keep NPO until mental status
   clears, follow finger sticks, humilog insulin sliding scale
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Continue
   amiodarone/diltiazem/metoporolol
