Chief Complaint:  respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   53 year-old woman with hx of COPD (with recent admission for COPD with
   exacerbation)
   She is now intubated and sedated, and history is obtained from ED notes
   and family.  She initially came to the ED with confusion, stating that
   she "felt like she was retaining CO2" and with 10/10 headache.
   In the ED, her vital signs included temp 95.7, HR 65, BP 237/75, RR 12,
   Pulse ox 95% RA.  A TNG infusion was started for hypertension.  She was
   treated with bronchodilators and BiPAP because she reported feeling as
   if she was retaining CO2 (but ABG 7/40 /45 / 74). She also noted
   abdominal pain and blurry vision. She developed increasing confused and
   agitation and was intubated for combativeness.  Her ED course was also
   notable for an episode of bradycardia to the 30s.
   LP in ED showed rbc 39 - 63, wbc [**2-5**] with ~40% PMNs, total protein 158,
   glucose 94, negative gram stain.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with
   Suspect that the major differential diagnosis here is hypertensive
   encephalopathy (PRES), encephalitis (e.g. HSV), and subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (not seen on CT).  The finding of elevated protein in the
   CSF suggests that this is a meaningful intracranial process rather than
   a red [**Doctor Last Name 1730**].
