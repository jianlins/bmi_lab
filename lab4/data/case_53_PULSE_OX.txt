Chief Complaint:  OSH transfer for STEMI
   HPI:
   78yo female with multiple medical problems including type 2 diabetes
   mellitus, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
   peripheral vascular disease, and AAA was transferred from an OSH with a
   STEMI.
   .
   In [**1-21**], patient recently fell at home from "legs buckling under her
   because of neuropathy" and was sent to rehab. While in rehab, she
   tripped on the stairs and broke her ankle with no subsequent surgical
   intervention. At rehab, she endorsed 2 separate episodes of epigastric
   burning over the past 2 weeks that lasted a short amount of time and
   was relieved by oxygen and vomiting.  Today she had another episode
   which she describes as an epigastric type burning sensation associated
   with nausea and vomiting. The character of the episode was similar to
   the [** Location **]us episodes; however this episode lasted longer.  She also
   endorsed pain radiating to her back and shortness of breath.
   .
   Upon initial evaluation by EMS at 11:09am, her vital signs were HR 58,
   BP 92/48, RR 16, and 88% on 2L.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 326**] and
   arrived at 12:15pm. Upon arrival at [**Hospital3 326**], vital signs were BP
   131/53, HR 86, RR 18, temp 98.4, and pulse ox 100% (unclear how much
   supplemental O2 she received). She received SL NG x 1, ASA 325mg PO x
   1, nitro gtt at 10mcg, dilaudid .5mg IV x 1, plavix 660mg PO x 1, and
   heparin drip. ECG at the OSH demonstrated STE in II, III, and avF with
   reciprocal STD in I, avL, V1, and V2.
   .
   She was med flighted to [**Hospital1 5**] where she was transferred to the cath lab
   and received aspirin 325mg PO, heparin bolus, integrelin, and
   potassium. She was found to have a subtotal occlusion in the mid left
   circumflex for which she received a bare metal stent.
   .
   Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**3332-2-18**] for a cardiac
   catheterization and she was found to have 95% stenosis of her left
   circumflex with a "miniscule" RCA with 30% mid segment stenosis.
   .
   Patient is on oxygen at baseline for COPD-usually 2L but recently
   increased to 2.5L. She also endorsed increased lower extremity swelling
   since her ankle fracture 3 weeks ago. She describes leg weakness and
   chronic back pain.
   .
   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
   buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
   negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of chest pain,
   dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, but absence of palpitations,
   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope or presyncope.

   Imaging:
   .
   CARDIAC CATH performed on [**3332-2-15**] demonstrated:
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
   a single vessel disease. The LMCA, and LAD had no angiographically
   apparent disease. The LCx had 95% stenosis at the origin of a very
   small OM2 branch. The RCA was miniscule with 30% mid segment stenosis.
   2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated LVEDP of 20mmHg.
   3. Left ventriculography revealed neither mitral regurgitation nor wall
   motion abnormalities. Calculated ejection fraction was 63%.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Minor branch disease.
   2. Normal ventricular function.
   .
   CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION on [**3335-3-26**]:
   initial angiography showed the mid LCX to be subtotally occluded at the
   site of known lesion (was seen on [**3332**] cath). We planned to treat this
   with direct stenting. A 6 French 3.5 XB guide provided adequate
   support. A Prowater wire crossed the lesion with minimal difficulty. A
   3.0x18 mm Vision BMS was deployed at 14 ATM. Final angiography revealed
   10% residual stenosis without dissection or distal emboli.
   The patient left the cath lab free from angina and in stable
   condition.
   COMMENTS:
   1-
   2-
   3-
   4- Successful primary angioplasty (direct stenting) of the mid LCX with
   a 3.0x18 mm Vision BMS. Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis
   without dissection or distal emboli.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Successful primary angioplasty with stenting of the mid LCX with a
   BMS.
   ECG: EKG demonstrated NS bradycardia with normal axis. Good R wave
   progression. PR interval wnl. STE in II, III, AvF with reciprocal
   changes with STD in AvL, I, V1 and V2. Clearly significantly changed
   from [**3332-2-15**].
   Assessment and Plan
   78yo female with a history of multiple medical problems including type
   2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease was
   admitted with STEMI and had a bare metal stent placed to the left
   circumflex.
   .
   1. CAD now s/pSTMEI: Has multiple risks for CAD as detailed above. Her
   history of multiple episodes of epigastric pain appears most consistent
   with unstable angina. Patient had STE in inferior region but has left
   dominant system. Patient had BMS to LCx and now is chest pain free.
   - continue aspirin
   - recommended that patient start statin, but she refused due to
   [** Location **]us episodes of myalgias with statin; will continue to readdress
   as patient has multiple other reasons for which she may have had leg
   pain
   - check fasting lipid panel in the AM
   - consider starting ACEI
   - consider starting beta blocker tomorrow if HR improves
   .
   2. Pump: Patient appears mildly hypervolemic currently but difficult to
   assess secondary to body habitus and post cath flat positioning.
   Patient was [** Location **]usly on multiple anti-hypertensive agents at her
   rehab facility, including hydralazine, CCB, and nitrate. Patient would
   certainly benefit from ACEI and beta blockade given her STEMI.
   - echocardiogram
   - hold furosemide for now given that patient appears euvolemic and
   consider restarting within the next 48 hours
   - consider starting beta blocker tonight if HR improves
   - consider starting ACEI tomorrow
   .
   3. Rhythm: Patient remains slightly bradycardic but in normal sinus
   rhythm.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry via ICU protocol
   .
   4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   - f/u A1C
   - continue insulin
   - add humalog sliding scale
   - hold oral hypoglycemics including actos for now and will plan to
   restart within the next 1-2 days
   .
   5. Vitamin D deficiency:Stable
   - continue vitamin D supplementation
   .
   6. GERD:Stable
   - continue prevacid
   .
   7. Glaucoma
   - continue xalatan eye drops
   .
   8. COPD: on 2L oxygen at baseline
   - continue xopenex, flovent, and atrovent
   .
   9. Anxiety: Given patient's acute illness and age, will hold BDP for
   now and consider restarting within the next 48-72 hours.
   .
   7. Pain: c/o back pain chronically worsened with lying flat post cath
   -continue gabapentin 100mg PO qhs
   -tylenol for now
