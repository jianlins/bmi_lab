Chief Complaint:  tachycardia
   HPI:
   62 yo male with history of renal cell carcinoma with mets and VP shunt
   was admitted from his nursing home with tachycardia.
   According to family, patient was found to have increased heart rate,
   decreased blood pressure, and having "junky" sounding lungs. They were
   then recommended to come to the hospital. Upon arrival to the ED, temp
   97, HR 135, BP 98/71, RR 14, and pulse ox 96% RA. Upon arrival to the
   ED, patient received 2.5-3L NS and 750mg IV levofloxacin x 1, 500mg IV
   flagyl x 1, decadron 10mg IV x 1, cefepime 1g IV x 1.
   Regarding his mental status, family reports that he has waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 40**] mental status. At his best, patient will respond to questions;
   however at his worst, patient looks like he is "sleeping with his eyes
   open."
   Patient did not answer any questions for me; however per nursing
   reports, patient denies being in pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma to brain and
   lungs was admitted with tachycardia and increased cough.
   PLAN:
   1. Tachycardia
   Patient with sinus tachycardia thought most likely secondary to
   infection. Most likely etiology for infection is pulmonary source given
   patient's decreased responsiveness and signs of pneumonia on CXR. Signs
   against pneumonia however are lack of leukocytosis and lack of fever
   (although may not mount an adequate response).  Additional source
   includes urinary tract infection, although difficult to assess in
   setting of traumatic and likely contaminated UA. Additional
   differential includes hypovolemia, although no clear history of
   decreased tube feeds, increased UOP, or increased stool. Blood
   pressures currently stable with MAP > 65. Additional possibility to
   consider includes PE. Given that patient is s/p right nephrectomy and
   currently appears dry, would be hesitant to check CTA. Also, patient
   would certainly be a poor anticoagulation candidate in the setting of
   brain mets.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - send sputum gram stain and culture
   - check urine legionella
   - send DFA
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin to cover
   hospital-acquired pneumonia and specifically pathogens of MRSA,
   Pseudomonas, and atypical
   - IVF bolus prn
   - chest PT
   - suctioning as needed
   - maintain 2 peripheral IVs
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - check LENIs
   - consider ordering VQ scan
   2. Metastatic Renal Cell Ca
   Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1726**] note on [**2979-3-2**], patient is currently off of sutent
   due to complications with bleeding. Systemic and neurologic disease
   currently appears stable per outpatient neuro-onc and oncology notes,
   and patient is to have follow-up scans as an outpatient.
   - will defer to outpatient team
   - will alert oncology and neuro-oncology teams to patient's admission
   - continue steroids
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 520**] regarding steroid taper
