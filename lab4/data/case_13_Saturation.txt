Date of service: [**3333-12-9**]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Dyspnea, Edema
   History of present illness: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3780**] is a 74-year-old man with
   idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, VT on amioderone, who was initially
   admitted for VT and ICD firings, s/p battery change and attempted
   ablation, who was sent from the CCU to the floor on [**3333-12-4**] but is now
   being transferred back to the CCU with worsening edema, dyspnea, and
   renal failure.
   The patient was euvolemic when he was transferred to the floor.
   However, for the past few days he has been oliguric with rising
   creatinine to 4.2. Urine lytes were consistent with prerenal azotemia.
   He received NS boluses, but urine output was still low. Diuretics were
   held. On [**3333-12-9**] he became more dyspneic, albeit with O2 saturation in
   the high 90s on room air, and persistently oliguric despite more NS
   boluses. His lung exam revealed worsening bibasilar crackles and cold,
   edematous lower extremities. Due to his worsening clinical status, he
   was transferred back to the CCU.

   Tests
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**3333-11-28**]), The left atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated with severe regional systolic
   dysfunction including akinesis of the inferolateral and anterolateral
   walls. Overall LVEF is ~25%. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The effective
   regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3780**] is a 74-year-old man with idiopathic dilated
   cardiomyopathy, VT on amiodarone, who was initially admitted for VT and
   ICD firings, s/p battery change and attempted ablation, who was sent
   from the CCU to the floor on [**3333-12-4**] but is now being transferred back
   to the CCU with worsening edema, dyspnea, and renal failure.
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure. Evidence of
   hypovolemia in the past few days with urine lytes consistent with
   prerenal azotemia. Lung exam reveals slightly worse bibasilar crackles,
   but patient still has high oxygen saturation on room air; hence, likely
   with minimal pulmorary edema. Extremities are cold and clammy,
   concerning for cardiogenic shock. However, worsening leukocytosis with
   a left shift and thrombocytopenia are concering for septic shock as
   well.
   - a-line
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - dopamine despite stable BP in order to increase forward flow
   - monitor I/O closely
   - compression stockings for peripheral edema
   # RHYTHM: history of VT with ICD  and on amio and mexilitine currently
   - continue amio and mexilitine
   # CORONARIES: no chest pain. No active issue.
   # Dyspnea: with stable O2 sat on room air. Bibasilar crackles on lung
   exam. Recent pneumonia might have not been completely treated.
   - monitor O2 sat closely
   - if desating, consider furosemide and, if necessary, intubation
   - repeat CXR
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo again
   # Renal failure: Cr has been rising to 4.2 today. Urine lytes so far
   have been consistent with prerenal azotemia, likely from hypovolemia.
   Renal ultrasound on [**3333-12-8**] was unrevealing. Labs reveal anion-gap
   metabolic acidosis, due to ?renal failure, sepsis,
   - f/u renal recs
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - monitor renal labs closely
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose all medications
   # Leukocytosis: WBC [**Numeric Identifier 3781**] with left shift. No fever. No diarrhea.
   Concurrent thrombocytopenia is suggestive of a consumption process
   secondary to an infection. WBC started to rise after discontinuation of
   vancomycin and pip-tazo on [**3333-12-5**], both of which were given for
   bilateral pneumonia. Elevated lactate is also consistent with an
   infectious process.
   - pan-culture
   - empiric vancomycin, pip-tazo, and metronidazole, the last of which is
   for C. diff
   - repeat C. diff toxin
   # Thrombocytopenia: plts in the 300s on admission, 92 today. Likely
   from an infectious process. Has been on heparin SC since admission on
   [**3333-11-25**]. 4T pre-test score is 4 (2 points each for amplitude of
   platelet drop and for timing). No sign of active bleeding.
   - stop heparin SC
   - send PF-4
   - send DIC labs
   - monitor CBC closely
   # Code: FULL
   # Access: PIV, a-line
   - will likely need CVL
   # Dispo: ICU care for now
   # Ppx: pneumoboots
