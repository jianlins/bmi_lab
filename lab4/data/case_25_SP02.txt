Chief Complaint:  Abdominal pain/nausea x24 hours
   HPI:
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a past medical history of
   hypertension, hypothyroidism, GI bleed in [**7-/2561**] who presents from home
   with abdominal pain, [**8-29**] and intermittent nausea, for the past 24
   hours.
   Upon arrival in ED, patient was febrile to 101.7, and elevated LFTs
   were concerning for cholangitis.  A CTA of the abdomen demonstrated a
   dilated CBD with a stone obstructing the ampula.  Patient was
   tachycardic to 120-130s, and was given IV fluids and cipro, flagyl,
   unasyn.  Crackles were heard at her lower lung bases, and IVF were
   eventually discontinued.  ERCP was consulted, and during the course of
   a long discussion with ERCP fellow, family, and geriatrics fellow, it
   was felt that surgical intervention (i.e. ERCP) would not be in
   accordance with patient's wishes as she is DNR/DNI.  The decision was
   made to treat patient with antibiotics and symptomatically, and she was
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for further work-up.  Upon transfer to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 42**], vitals were: VS: 101.7 129/59 128 24 96% 4L.  An extensive note
   in the chart by ERCP fellow documents entirety of this conversation.
   Upon arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**], patient complained of abdominal discomfort
   and missing her daughter.  She also complained of thirst.  Vitals on
   arrival were: T: 98.8, BP: 108/43, RR: 28, SP02 92% on 2L.
   ROS:  Patient is a poor historian.  But she denies headache, chest
   pain, shortness of breath, dysuria, or change in bowel habits.

   Wet Read Audit # 2 CXWc [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2561-11-20**] 2:38 PM
   1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia. Patent mesenteric vessels.
   2. Markedly dilated CBD measuring up to 17mm, extending to the ampulla,
   which bulges into the duodenum and is concerning for an obstructing
   ampullary mass. Mild dilation of the ventral pancreatic duct to 6mm.
   Distal/dorsal panc duct not dilated due to pancreatic divisum. Moderate
   intrahepatic ductal dilatation. ERCP or MRCP recommended.
   3. Distended gallbladder with stones and pericholecystic fluid; likely
   due to biliary obstruction rather than acute cholecystitis but
   correlate clinically.
   4. Extensive colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
   .
   CXR: No acute intrathoracic process. No evidence of free air under the
   hemidiaphragms.
   .
   KUB: Paucity of bowel gas in the upper abdomen with no dilated loops of
   small bowel identified. No definite free air is identified. However, an
   upright view of the abdomen is recommended for further evaluation.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old lady with choledocholithiasis vs. cholangitis who
   presents from home with a 24-hour history of abdominal pain and nausea
   with CT abdomen suggestive of distal CBD obstruction with stone and
   pancreatitis.  Now with 2/4 blood cultures (so far) growing gram
   negative rods.
   CBD OBSTRUCTION/PANCREATITIS:  Patient is bacteremic with gram negative
   rods, likely source being biliary tract.  After long discussions with
   family, ERCP team, and geriatrics, the decision was made not to pursue
   ERCP and to keep patient comfortable and on anti-biotics.  The family
   is aware that patient could pass away from overwhelming infection, but
   they do not believe that invasive procedures and/or intubation would be
   in accordance with her wishes.  Although the obstruction looked like it
   could be a ampullary mass on initial read of CT, radiology attending
   asserted that it was most likely a stone.
   .
   --Zosyn for empiric gram negative coverage
   --Fluid as 02 sats tolerate
   --Pain control with morphine
   --Continue family discussions/family input
   --Ap[** Location **]te ERCP recommendations
   .
   TACHYCARDIA:  Most likely a combination of pain, anxiety, fever, and
   infection.  In order to control the tachycardia, we need to treat the
   underlying source.
   --Antibiotics
   --Reorientation, anxiolytics (if needed) for anxiety
   --Pain control with morphine
   --EKG if rhythm changes, patient becomes hemodynamically compromised.
   .
   HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Continue home levothyroxine dose for now.
   .
   HYPERTENSION:  Hold off on home anti-hypertensive medications, as
   patient has SBPs in the 80s-90s.
   .
   AGITATION:  Patient is very agitated overnight, require restraints as
   not to rip out her IVs.  She received IV haldol PRN.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: [**Age over 90 **] y/o, female with history of HTN,
   hypothyroidism, CVA, GIB, now presents with 10/10 diffuse abdominal
   pain associated with nausea, febrile in ED with elevated LFT's and
   stone of CBD causing CBD dilation, ampula obstruction, cholangitis,
   pancreatitis. ERCP were consulted and given her DNR/DNI status, the
   family
s decision was to treat medically and not to proceed with ERCP.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.7, current  98.8 BP 129/59 HR 128 RR 28 with
   sat 92% on 2 L. N/C . Abdomen diffuse tenderness with palpation. Labs
   notable for WBC 9.9 K, HCT 40.7, K+ 2.8, Cr 0.9, lactate 3.4. CXR with
   , EKG . Blood cultures 2/4 Gram negative rods.
   Agree with plan to treat cholangitis, pancreatitis, bacteremia with
   broad spectrum antibiotics, IVF's, supplemental oxygen, replete
   electrolytes.
   Patient is DNR/DNI and family are aware of potential poor prognosis by
   declining the ERCP including septic shock and death.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
