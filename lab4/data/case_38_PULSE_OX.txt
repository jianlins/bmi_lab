   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   52yo man with a h/o  EtOH-induced cirrhosis with esophageal and rectal
   varices with prior episodes of bleeding admitted with painless brbpr
   and hypotension. He had multiple episodes of bright red blood in his
   stool starting this morning. With this brbpr . He denies any NSAID or
   EtOH use. He presented to [**Hospital 2988**] Hospital where his SBP was 85 with a HR
   of 102. His BP nadir there was 68/36. He Hct on admission was 17.6%
   with an INR 1.9. EKG unremarkable, CXR clear. He received 2 units of
   PRBC and NS x 1L, protonix 80 mg IV, octreotide 50 mcg then 25 mcg/hr.
   He was transferred here for further care.
   In the [**Hospital1 5**] ED, he was afebrile with a SBP of 89, HR of 100, and a
   pulse ox of 100% on RA. His Hct was 25.5%, he received 3 more units of
   pRBCs, 2 units FFP were ordered but not yet given.
   He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 5**] from [**8-15**] to [**2756-9-7**] for UGIB due
   to duodenal ulcer, alcoholic hepatitis treated with corticosteroids,
   hepatorenal syndrome, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation. His last EGD was on [**8-16**] and showed esophageal varices,
   blood in the stomach, blood in the second part of the duodenum, and a
   large visible vessel in the proximal duodenum. C-scope [**9-5**] showed
   medium non-bleeding grade 2 internal hemorrhoids and two 4mm non-

   Assessment and Plan
   52yo man with a h/o  EtOH-induced cirrhosis with esophageal and rectal
   varices with prior episodes of bleeding admitted with painless brbpr
   and hypotension.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   GI performed endoscopy on arrival to the MICU and there was no clear
   source of brisk bleeding. There was an area of possible prior bleeding
   at the ampula, a possible non-bleeding ucler. On Protonix IV,
   Octreotide and Ceftriaxone as per UGIB protocol. He has adequate IV
   access with a central line and 3 pIVs. Liver service to repeat EGD this
   AM given the positive tagged RBC scan last night.
 END STAGE LIVER DISEASE
   Hold Spironolactone and Lasix in the acute setting. Hold Lactulose
   while monitoring him for further episodes of GI bleeding. Follow Liver
   recs.
 ETOH USE
   None since [**7-3**]. Will monitor prospectively. No need for benzos at this
   time. No e/o alcoholic hepatitis.
 RENAL
   He had acute renal failure during his prior hospitalization; his
   creatinine is currently within normal limits. Will follow his
   creatinine and UOP going forward.
