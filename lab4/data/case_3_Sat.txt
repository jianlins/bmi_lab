   DIVISION OF CARDIOLOGY CCU COMPREHENSIVE ADMISSION NOTE
   .
   OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST:  [**Doctor Last Name 8476**]
   .
   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post mitral valvuloplasty
   .
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
   .
   Mr [**Known patient lastname 787**] is a 73 year old man with complicated past medical history
   including large B cell non-hodgkins lymphoma, mitral stenosis, Afib,
   seizure disorder, electively admitted for valvuloplasty, transferred to
   CCU for close monitoring.
   .
   Briefly, patient was admitted on [**8-28**] with SOB and DOE and was
   evaluated for valvuloplasty, however at that time was found to have a
   clot in the right atrium and procedure was deferred. He remained
   anticoagulated and repeat TEE yesterday revealed persistent left atrial
   appendage clot with smoke. Became hypotensive during the procedure and
   was given 2L IV fluids, thought to be multifactorial from poor PO
   intake, sedation, and afib with RVR. Today, he underwent planned mitral
   vavuloplasty uneventfully with improvement in mitral valve area from
   1.2 to 3.7 cm2 (gradient decreased from 10 to 2 mmHg); cardiac index
   was 2.5 L/min/m2; mean PCWP 17 mmHg with LVEDP 9 mmHg. He currently has
   no complaints.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
   thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
   recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
   pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**3429-10-30**]): Report pending.
   .
   TEE ([**3429-10-28**]): The left atrium is severely dilated. Mild to moderate
   spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
   Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
   atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
   depressed (<0.2m/s). Definite thrombus is seen in the left atrial
   appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
   of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%) (not fully assessed).
   Right ventricular free wall motion may be depressed. There are simple
   atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the
   aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly to moderately thickened. The mitral valve
   shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. The mitral stenosis gradient
   was not assessed. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A TEE procedure related
   complication occurred (see comments for details). IMPRESSION: Left
   atrial appendage thrombus with prominent spontaneous echo contrast in
   the left atrium and left atrial appendage. Mitral stenosis with
   rheumatic deformity. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**3429-9-11**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced on the
   current study. The other findings are similar.
   .
   ICE ([**3429-10-30**]: The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
   contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No thrombus/mass is
   seen in the body of the left atrium. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is normal right ventricular free
   wall contractility. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
   mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is
   moderate valvular mitral stenosis (mean gradient, 8 mmHg). Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   CARDIAC CATH:  cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] on [**3429-8-6**]. The
   catheterization revealed significant mitral stenosis with an MVA
   of 1cm2. The coronary anatomy revealed a 50% OM2 lesion but all
   other vessels without significant disease.
   .
   HEMODYNAMICS ([**3429-10-30**]):  Mitral vavuloplasty uneventfully with
   improvement in mitral valve area from 1.2 to 3.7 cm2 (gradient
   decreased from 10 to 2 mmHg); cardiac index was 2.5 L/min/m2; mean PCWP
   17 mmHg with LVEDP 9 mmHg.

   .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   .
   73 yo gentleman with PMH significant for CVA, B-cell non-hodgkin's
   lymphoma, chronic afib on anticoagulation, s/p elective valvuloplasty
   for mitral stenosis.
   .
   #: MITRAL STENOSIS: Patient s/p mitral valvuloplasty without
   complication. Gradient significantly reduced post-intervention.
   -- Post cath check
   -- Monitor for evidence of embolization
   -- ECHO in AM.
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Continue rate control and IV heparin for
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -- resume warfarin and heparin 4 hrs after sheath pull
   -- currently rate controlled off agents, will monitor
   .
   # PUMP: Normal systolic function. PCWP elevated [** Location **]tervention,
   expect diminished post.
   .
   # Wt Loss: Concern for progression of his lymphoma vs deconditioning
   and poor PO intake in the setting of his valvular dysfunction.
   -valvuloplasty as above
   -will attempt to obtain outside heme/onc notes today
   .
   # Hx B-cell lymphoma: s/p chemo/radiation/diverting colostomy.
   .
   # Hx seizures: no recent seizure activity
   -- continue depakote
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine
   .
   FEN:  Regular diet
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, venous and arterial sheaths to be pulled later
