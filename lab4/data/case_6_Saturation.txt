TITLE: Critical Care Staff
   70F with diastolic CHF exacerbation. Also acute on CRF. Managing to
   avoid intubation with CPAP, but dependent on NIPPV. Hemodynamically
   stable. Some diuresis, on extremely high doses of diuretics.
   Temp 96 137/29 (after started on labetolol- has SBP 170-190 overnight)
   HR 70
   CPAP 8, 0.4, sat low 90s. Has had brief periods off CPAP and able to
   maintain oxygen saturation. Seems to have pattern of rising blood
   pressure off of NIPPV which then leads to oxygen desaturation.
   -2.3L on lasix gtt 14/hr and diuril [**Hospital1 **] (held for concern regarding PO
   meds), 7L neg LOS
   CXR unchanged since yesterday with volume overload bilat pleural
   effusions
   Exam sig for labored breathing on face tent, able to speak short
   sentances, 2+ pitting edema, shallow breaths, diminished at bases.
   Distant HS. Abd hypoactive BS, soft NDNT. No new rashes or joint
   inflammation.
   Echo: LVH, nl LVEF, mild PASP, nl RV, enlarged RA
   A/P
   Admitted for resp failure due to diastolic CHF, CPAP dependent. Has
   been able to tolerate 1-2 hours off CPAP but develops resp fatigue.
    1. CHF exacerbation, flash pulm edema- diastolic HF- due to HTN, med
       noncompliance
       increase diuresis, afterload reduction with nitroglycerin in
   addition to lasix
       HTN control
    2. resp failure: continue CPAP as needed
    3. ARF (on CRF Cr rose 2--> 4 over past 3-4 months)- renal consult for
       extremely high doses of diuretics
    4. Access is a problem- she has 1 old peripheral IV. Try for more
       peripheral access. Line placement would be a challenge since pt
       cannot lay flat.
    5. need more definitive discussion with family. Discuss with PCP
       [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6602**] considering what appear to be confusing family
       dynamic. (Pt seems to want to avoid interventions, intubation, and
       daughters want aggressive care regardless of likely outcome).
   50 minutes critical care time.
