TSICU
   HPI:
   65 M admitted to TSICU from PACU-East due to post-op fever spike to
   104, tachycardia to 140s, and hypotension to 90s. Pt has a hx of
   prostate ca s/p RRP and adjuvant XRT in [**2729**], recent difficulty with
   radiation cystitis and hematuria. Today had removal of his suprapubic
   tube and construction of urinary diversion- an ileal conduit.
   Reportedly the procedure was without complication, and the patient went
   to the PACU in good condition, EBL 150 cc intraop. Approx 4 hours
   post-op, the pt's tachycardia increased to the 140s, BP dropped, and
   fever spike as above. Abx were broaded to vanc/zosyn, crystalloid
   bolused to total approx 6000cc from OR and PACU. Pt sent to TSICU for
   further resuscitation and monitoring.

   Assessment and Plan
   PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN), HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK), FEVER
   (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN), TACHYCARDIA,
   OTHER
   Assessment and Plan: 65 M s/p construction of ileal conduit, admitted
   to ICU for post-op tachycardia, hypotension, fever, ? sepsis. Upon
   arrival to the ICU, generally well appearing, mentating well, with
   improved vitals.
   Neurologic: A&0x3, has epidural in place for pain, currently adequately
   controlled at level [**1-4**]. Pain: Continue epidural, f/u APS recs
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardia resolving to low 100s, hypotension
   improved, BPs now 105/60 with fluids; pt is clinically fluid
   responsive. Will check lactate, labs, continue agressive crystalloid
   resuscitation, repeat hct.
   Pulmonary: stable, sp02 high 90s on 2 liters NC
   Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: npo for now, NGT in place
   Nutrition: NPO
   Renal: f/u ileal conduit output, foley with bloody drainage- will leave
   foley for now, though do not expect much output- bladder likely to clot
   per urology
   Hematology: Serial Hct
   Endocrine: RISS
   Infectious Disease: Check cultures, Empiric Vanco/Zosyn for sepsis
   physiology, with urine/bacteremia as likely source. Prior infections
   sensitive to vanc/zosyn. Follow cultures.
   Lines / Tubes / Drains: Foley, Surgical drains (hemovac, JP), epidural
   catheter for pain
   Wounds:

   Fluids: LR boluses for resuscitation, then will put on maintenance IVF
