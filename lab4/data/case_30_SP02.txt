TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Weakness
   HPI:
   74-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD (last dialysis on [**3-12**]), cryptogenic cirrhosis, history of PEs, and
   chronically low BPs who is brought in by his partner for 2-3 days of
   worsening confusion and weakness. Patient was recently admitted to
   [**Hospital1 17**] on [**3022-1-7**] for orthostatic symptoms; admission was complicated by
   an iatrogenic peritonitis (induced by paracentesis) for which the
   patient received a 14 day course of antibiotics. He has been feeling
   well since this time, though did present to his PCP recently for
   bilateral pitting edema (DVT ruled out at that time). Pt currently
   denies weakness and reports that he would like coffee. He denies fever,
   chills, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary symtpoms, cough, chest
   pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. He does endorse recent
   anorexia for the past few days that he relates to fatigue.
   .
   In the ED, patient's Temp was 97, BP was 67/47, HR of 96, and SP02 of
   91% on RA. Bibasilar crackles bilaterally and significant pedal edema.
   Neuro exam was reportedly normal (A&Ox3, no asterixis) and there was no
   ascites on abdominal exam. Elevated white count, INR, and LFTs.
   Troponin of 0.25, which is higher than baseline. EKG with NSR in the
   90s and no ST changes. Patient received vanc/zosyn and ASA in ED.
   Received 3L NS in ED, but still had an elevated lactate. At baseline pt
   is hypotensive, P 75-80, RR 18, 98% 2L NC.

   Social History:
   1. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: A portal hypertension, splenomegaly,
   and ascites per MRI of abdomen. Portal vein thrombosis noted on
   MRI from [**11/3020**] as well as more recent ultrasound.
   2. Chronic kidney disease stage IV-V currently undergoing
   hemodialysis, possibly due to chronic nephrolithiasis, in turn
   caused by a bowel surgery, possibly combined with chronic
   hypokalemia and nonsteroidal use. More recently suggested that
   the possibility of amyloidosis be explored. The patient has
   secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure.
   3. Chronic secretory diarrhea: Carcinoid syndrome,
   neuroendocrine tumors, pellagra, microscopic colitis,
   hyperthyroidism, and infectious etiologies have been ruled out
   with an extensive workup in 06/[**3019**]. Currently, attributed to a
   history of ileal resection.
   4. History of PE during hospitalization [**5-/3020**] at [**Hospital1 17**].
   Formerly on Coumadin is stopped in 01/[**3020**].

   greater than 900 during hospitalization in 06/[**3019**].
   6. H. pylori gastritis treated in [**3019**].
   7. MGUS by SPEP.
   8. A 1.2-cm hypoechoic nodule on the left thyroid lobe without
   enlargement on ultrasound, follow up in [**3020**]. TSH remains normal
   in 01/[**3020**].
   9. Left inguinal hernia.
   10. Status post ileal resection in [**2971**] for possible Crohn's
   disease.
   11. Status post surgical repair perforated ulcer in the [**2981**].
   12. Status post surgical removal of renal stone in [**2981**].
   13. Cataracts
   14. Paracentesis induced bowel perforation in [**12-23**]
   15. Thyroid nodule
   Denies family history of liver or kidney disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**3-12**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70
   - Broadly culture
   - Continue antibiotics for now.
   - Check Cortisol
   - Check TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of a[** Location **]e for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derrangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 23**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness.
   -Blood cultures
   -Hold off on paracentesis for now given absence of abd pain
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Repeat electrolyte panel
   -Repeat lactate
   -IVF
   -Touch base with renal re: further dialysis
   -Continue vanc/zosyn for now
   -RUQ U/S with dopplers in am
   -Nutrition consult
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponin is 0.25, which is up from
   baseline (especially in light of dialysis yesterday). Difficult to
   interpret baseline EKG, but no overt ST changes concerning for evolving
   infarct.
   -Continue ROMI
   -Repeat EKG
   -Consider ECHO in am given non-specific fatigue.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 57 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of s[** Location **] sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites).
   - Repeat plt count
   - Send RBC morph and IHOS to reveiw for presence of schistos
   - RUQ U/s as above
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. [** Location **]usly the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - Send for Cdiff given recent abx
   .

   in am
