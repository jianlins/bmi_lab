   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   44 yo female with history of hypertension and IVDU presents with
   tachycardia and hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication
   noncompliance.
   1. Hypertension
   Etiology of her hypertension appears most likely secondary to
   medication noncompliance, particularly given the risks of rebound
   hypertension with clonidine use. Additional possibilities include
   benzodiazepine withdrawal as pt reports that she was recently taken off
   of alprazolam and was given diazepam within the last week. Her blood
   pressure has significantly improved since transfer to the floor.
   - restart home meds
   - increase HCTZ to 25mg daily
   - consider adding third [**Doctor Last Name **] such as a CCB tomorrow if BP is still
   elevated
   - titrate off nitro gtt
   - send serum and urine tox screens
   2. Tachycardia
   Differential diagnosis for patient's tachycardia includes dehydration
   or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Regarding benzodiazepine withdrawal,
   patient was [** Location **]usly taking xanax and then her primary care stopped
   providing her xanax. She then went to the ED on [**2840-5-1**] where she was
   prescribed both percocet and valium. If she has taken valium over the
   last week, she has likely tapered off benzodiazepines herself with a
   long acting benzodiazepine. Given that her tachycardia worsened while
   being in the ED, this appears most consistent with a withdrawal
   syndrome.
   - send serum and urine tox screens
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue IVF
   3. IVDU
   Patient reports a rela[** Location **] heroin use in the last week.
   - Addictions consult once hemodynamically stable
   4. Oral Ulcer
   Unclear etiology for oral ulcer. Differential includes infectious or
   pre-malignant/malignant lesion.
   - swab lesion
   - consider ENT referral in the AM for further evaluation.
   5. Asthma
   Patient appears stable and appears well-controlled on current regimen.
   - continue advair, albuterol prn, and singulair prn
   6. Nausea and vomiting
   Symptoms appear to have resolved now. Etiology is unclear. Differential
   includes gastroenteritis, withdrawal. Abdominal exam benign.
   - antiemetics prn
   - continue to follow
