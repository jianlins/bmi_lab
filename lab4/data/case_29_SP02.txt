Chief Complaint:  ?Septic joint
   HPI:
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo Russian-speaking man with PMHx sig. for tachy-brady
   syndrome s/p PCM, afib on coumadin, CVA in [**3210**], and dementia who
   presents with R shoulder pain and fever.  He first was seen in the ED
   on [**1-16**] for right wrist pain and swelling.  He had a tap that showed
   WBC 4250, RBC [**Numeric Identifier 11299**], 57%PMNs, 13%L, 30%M. and was discharged home.  He
   represented in the ED on [**1-18**] with continued wrist pain and erythema
   and was admitted to Medicine.  No fever at that point.  Pt had an x-ray
   of the R wrist showed "no fracture or dislocation. Generalized
   demineralization. Joint space narrowing and associated osteophytes at
   the first CMC joint. Minimal chondrocalcinosis and vascular
   calcifications."  Plastic surgery/Hand servcie was consulted and did
   not feel that he had evidence of septic arthritis.  He was treated for
   cellulitis and rapidly improved on Vancomycin/CTX.  Blood cultures were
   negative.  He was discharged on [**3222-1-23**] on 10 day course of
   Vancomycin/CTX.  The hospital course was also notable for severe
   constipation and fecal impaction.
   .
   Today, pt presents from NH with complaint of shoulder pain.  Per his
   wife who visits him on a daily basis, he was fine until this morning.
   He was complaining of R shoulder pain.  The nursing home noted that he
   was yelling out in pain.  VS were:  pulse 86-104, sat 96% on RA.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals were: 97.3 84 irreg 107/74
   18 98.  He had a temp up to 105 rectally.  X-ray showed no fracture or
   dislocation.  US showed moderate-sized right shoulder joint effusion
   with debris and internal septations.  Ortho was consulted and attempted
   to tap the joint, unsuccessful.  He received Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
   Vitals prior to transfer were: 99.5, 98, 138/76, 22, 97% on 2L.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   [**Age over 90 **] yo Russian-speaking man with PMHx sig. for tachy-brady syndrome s/p
   PCM, CVA in [**3210**], and dementia who presents with R shoulder pain and
   fever, concerning for septic shoulder.
   .
   #.  R shoulder pain:  According to Ortho, 20 cc of purulent drainage
   aspirated from R shoulder.  48,000 WBC in aspirate.  This is most
   concerning for septic shoulder given his fever, leukocytosis.  This may
   have been brewing since last admission as he was discharged with a
   lidocaine patch on his shoulder.  He was discharged on Vanc/CTX, which
   is adequate coverage for Strep/Staph/gram-neg bacilli.  However, source
   control would require OR.  No crystals in aspirate to suggest
   gout/pseudogout.  There is evidence of degenerative disease.
   - cont. vanc/CTX
   - f/u gram stain, joint fluid culture
   - Ortho following, would need wash-out
   .
   #.  Fever:  Patient's only complaint is R shoulder pain.  CXR does not
   reveal any infiltrate.  U/A was unremarkable for infection.  Given abx
   use, C. diff is a concern but pt reporting constipation rather than
   diarrhea.  PICC line site was nontender, nonerythematous without
   purulence.  Per wife, mental status is at baseline.
   - As above
   .
   #.  A.fib:  Currently rate-controlled
   - hold metoprolol while with sepsis
   - therapeutic on coumadin, hold for now given question of OR
   - can use heparin gtt as needed for bridge
   .
   #.  HTN:
   - hold metoprolol as above
   .
   FEN:  IVF boluses, monitor/replete electrolytes, NPO for now given
   question of surgery
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with coumadin
   -Bowel regimen colace, senna, and miralax
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
