   Imaging: CT head [**2565-6-5**] pre-op: Subdural hematoma layering over the
   right frontoparietal curvature producing 7 mm of leftward shift.
   CT head [**2565-6-5**] post-op: 1. Overall decreased blood products and midline
   shift post right subdural evacuation. 2. High density (70 [**Doctor Last Name **]) right
   extra axial collection measuring up to 7 mm from the inner table may
   represent residual subdural blood or epidural hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
   PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN), FALL(S), IMPAIRED HEALTH
   MAINTENANCE, SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   Assessment and Plan: 91 F s/p fall approx one month ago, on ASA, found
   to have large R SDH, now s/p evacuation.
   Neurologic: Neuro checks Q: 1 hr
 change to Q2,. Pain: dilaudid prn
   change to percocet PO. Neurosurg aware of post-op head CT findings,
   will follow clinical exam. Low threshold for repeat CT if neuro exam
   changes. Currently A&O to person, place, events, MAE. Continue dilantin
   for now, f/u with neurosurg re: ? need to increase given low level.
   Cardiovascular: HD stable, Metoprolol (home med) and Hydral to keep SBP
   < 140
   Pulmonary: extubated successfully post-op, Sp02 high 90s on room air.
   Per neurosurgery on 100% FiO2 to resolve pneumocephalus. Otherwise
   stable. OOB
 chair
   Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: ADAT
   Nutrition: Regular diet, Advance diet as tolerated
   Renal: has UTI, treating with cipro x5days per neurosurg. Will f/u with
   primary team UTI management with cipro given concern for seizure and
   switching to an alternative antibiotics.
   Hematology: trend cbc, nl plt and stable post-op mild anemia
   Endocrine: RISS with adequate glucose control. Keep < 150
   Infectious Disease: vancomycin for drain prophylaxis, cipro for UTI, ?
   changing cipro.
