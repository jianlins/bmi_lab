Chief Complaint:  Bright red blood per rectum
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   52yo man with a h/o  EtOH-induced cirrhosis with esophageal and rectal
   varices with prior episodes of bleeding admitted with painless brbpr
   and hypotension. He had multiple episodes of bright red blood in his
   stool starting this morning. With this brbpr . He denies any NSAID or
   EtOH use. He presented to [**Hospital 2988**] Hospital where his SBP was 85 with a HR
   of 102. His BP nadir there was 68/36. He Hct on admission was 17.6%
   with an INR 1.9. EKG unremarkable, CXR clear. He received 2 units of
   PRBC and NS x 1L, protonix 80 mg IV, octreotide 50 mcg then 25 mcg/hr.
   He was transferred here for further care.
   In the [**Hospital1 5**] ED, he was afebrile with a SBP of 89, HR of 100, and a
   pulse ox of 100% on RA. His Hct was 25.5%, he received 3 more units of
   pRBCs, 2 units FFP were ordered but not yet given.
   He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 5**] from [**8-15**] to [**2756-9-7**] for UGIB due
   to duodenal ulcer, alcoholic hepatitis treated with corticosteroids,
   hepatorenal syndrome, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation. His last EGD was on [**8-16**] and showed esophageal varices,
   blood in the stomach, blood in the second part of the duodenum, and a
   large visible vessel in the proximal duodenum. C-scope [**9-5**] showed
   medium non-bleeding grade 2 internal hemorrhoids and two 4mm non-
   bleeding ulcers noted on the hemorrhoid at a site of [** Location **]us banding.

   Assessment and Plan
   52yo man with a h/o  EtOH-induced cirrhosis with esophageal and rectal
   varices with prior episodes of bleeding admitted with painless brbpr
   and hypotension.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   GI performed endoscopy on arrival to the MICU and there was no clear
   source of brisk bleeding. There was an area of possible prior bleeding
   at the ampula, a possible non-bleeding ucler. A small bowel or lower
   intestinal source of his bleeding on presentation is certainly possible
   and further evaluation (push-enteroscopy +/- c-scope) will be
   considered going forward. For the time being, if indeed this was an
   upper GI bleed that has spontaneously resolved, we will continue
   Protonix IV and Octreotide as per UGIB protocol. He should receive
   Ceftriaxone for a 7 day course. Will follow his Hcts serially and, more
   importantly, his HR and BP in the acute setting for any clinical e/o
   brisk bleeding. He has two 20g IVs and an 18g IV. We will place a
   central line for frequent blood draws and resuscitation should he
   require it.
 END STAGE LIVER DISEASE
   Hold Spironolactone and Lasix in the acute setting. Hold Lactulose
   while monitoring him for further episodes of GI bleeding. Follow Liver
   recs.
 ETOH USE
   None since [**7-3**]. Will monitor prospectively. No need for benzos at this
   time. No e/o alcoholic hepatitis.
 RENAL
   He had acute renal failure during his prior hospitalization; his
   creatinine is currently within normal limits. Will follow his
   creatinine and UOP going forward.

   Nutrition: NPO for now.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   52M with cirrhosis, here with GIB. Upper endoscopy did not offer and
   explanation. He continues to bleed and is receiving a series of PRBCs.
   He is currently awaiting a bleeding scan with the possibility of
   embolization if the results are positive.

   Labs reviewed and recorded above
   Imaging:
   abd U/S 1. Partially occluded portal vein thrombosis which is new when
   compared to
   prior exam. 2. Cirrhotic-appearing liver with ascites.  3. Patent
   umbilical vein.  4. Splenomegaly. 5. Gallbladder sludge and wall
   thickening likely due to chronic liver  disease. No evidence of acute
   cholecystitis. 6. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
   CXR LIJ, clear
   Problems: GIB, blood loss anemia, cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis,
   EtOH abuse
   Agree with plan to maintain adequate access, continue to transfuse PRBC
   and FFP as needed, cont octreotide for now, tagged RBC scan with
   possible embolization, surgery and liver aware and involved.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.
