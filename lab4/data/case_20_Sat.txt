Clinician:  Attending
   Pt was seen and examined with Housestaff. I agree with their thoughts
   and would add emphasize the following.
   55 yr old woman with hx of type I DM, gastroparesis and recurrent DKA
   presents with 1 week of abd pain, constipation, and DKA. In ED she was
   tachycardic but hemodynamically stable - however WBC 21 bicarb 9 and
   GLc 774 and anion gap 35 and lactate 4.6 Due to difficult access she
   had femoral line placed.
   She was given IVF and insulin and had KUB and abd CT - non diagnostic.
   Tx to MICU
   On exam 100-110 O2 sats 97%
   she was alert NAD
   moist muc membranes
   RR
   CTA
   abd diffusely tender to deeep palp but without rebound or guarding.
   ext no edema
   Labs notable for WBC 21, initial bicarb 9 then 15 then 21 with IVF and
   insulin CR 1.9 to 1.1 after IVF
   CXR clear
   KUB: stool non obstructed gas pattern
   ABd CT : no obstruction, ++ stool
   Imp: 58 yr old with DKA
   DKA: [** Location **]itant unclear- she report fevers and abd pain at home, plan
   to cover with Cipro, Flagyl, follow up blood urine and stool cultures,
   Currently s/p initial resuscitation now getting 1/2 NS, would continue
   insulin drip as she is not eating and would like to see gap closed. The
   team gave home lantus but glc now back up to 175- need to trend
   carefully with D5 running , lantus on board and need for possible
   repeat insulin drip- check FS q1
   Cycle CKs- though no acute ECG changes
   ARF: improving with IVF
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.
   Total time spent:  40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.
